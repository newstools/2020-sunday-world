Organised business has come out in support of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plan to combat the novel Coronavirus.
Business Unity South Africa (Busa) in a statement said it has called on its members to make the maximum possible contribution to contain the virus. Busa president Sipho Pityana said BUSA has also committed the resources of its Covid-19 task team — which has developed a detailed business response to the virus — in support of government’s measures. “We are urging our member organisations to ensure that the President’s measures are implemented as speedily as possible, and to increase awareness and positive action wherever possible,” Pityana said. Ramaphosa on Sunday announced a state of disaster in an attempt to ward of the deadly virus that has claimed more than 6 000 lives worldwide. The President also referred to the potentially damaging impact on the economy that the Covid-19 virus will have. Busa said the stat the measures announced by the President which include closure of ports, travel restrictions from the USA, China and Europe which are South Africa’s biggest trading partners will exacerbate the economic crisis we are already experiencing, and business will work with government and labour to pull resources and capacity together to mitigate the economic, health and social risks posed by the virus. Pityana added: “The measures announced by the President will disrupt all our lives and no doubt have a massive impact on economic activity, but we have no other choice but to act, and to act in unison.” By Kabelo Khumalo
