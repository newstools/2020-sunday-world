Choreographer cast in ‘Rhythm City’ Local choreographer Vusumuzi Majola has secured a debut acting gig with Rhythm City. This after the 7pm weekday youth drama, in less than a month, announced the loss of its actors Jamie Bartlett, Samkelo Ndlovu and Amo Chidi. Majola, who choreographs for the iconic Sara na and S’timela sase Zola theatre shows, will play the controversial Ruby Rent Boy, who will date his male landlord Khulekani. The pride activist, who is also Somizi Mhlongo’s assistant choreographer, said the part was exciting for him because he gets to show pieces of his true self – a hyperactive gay character. Etv head of local productions Ziyanda Mngomezulu said: “On behalf of the Rhythm City team, we would like to wish Samkelo and Amo all the best for their future.” By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
