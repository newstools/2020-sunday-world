President Cyril Ramaphosa has cancelled a trip to Ethiopia, amid concerns over the spreading of the Coronavirus around the globe. Ramaphosa, in his capacity as African Union chairperson, was supposed to meet with the commissioners of the continental body on Thursday. “The President’s request arises from the priority he is giving to South Africa’s national response to the global COVID-19 pandemic,” a statement reads. “The President is leading the National Command Council which meets three times a week to coordinate the multisectoral response to COVID-19,” the statement added. AU commissioners support Ramaphosa in running the commission and have the responsibility to implement all decisions, policies and programmes across eight portfolios that include peace and security. Meanwhile, Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa condemned the organizers of the Comrades Marathon for suggesting the event will go ahead as planned, saying the comments were irresponsible in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande also announced that all higher education institutions will close with schools tomorrow. By George Matlala
