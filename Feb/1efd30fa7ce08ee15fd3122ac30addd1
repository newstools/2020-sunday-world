Zahara has been accused by a top designer, Otsile Sefolo, of being “a devil” for not paying for services rendered. She allegedly failed to pay for the rental of his outfits and returning it dirty. The designer took to social media to vent his frustration after fans praised her performance at Emperors Palace Casino last week. “@sbuiim more like the devil herself is onstage. This lady has screwed me over twice. She failed to pay me the money she owed me from the dress I made for her in 2016 and now she wears my designs and fails to give us credit for our work and has the audacity to bring back the dress dirty,” wrote Sefolo.  The comments were later deleted by the designer. Zahara whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, officially kicked off her residence wearing a white mesh off the shoulder dress, crafted by Sefolo. The popular designer who is known for his showcases at the South African Fashion Week, however, declined to comment when probed further immediately after making the post. But Zahara’s manager, Oyama Dyosiba said the designer claims Zahara had outstanding payments for the rental of his outfits and the agreement with the stylist, was apparently that she at least credit Sefolo. Dyosiba said the matter has since been resolved. It is not clear how much she owes. “I asked him to send the banking details which can be resolved immediately. We have spoken and everything has been resolved. Firstly the person who was doing our styling and outsourcing our clothes for the show did not let us know that we were meant to tag him. Yes, we used different designers but when it came to posting that specific dress we forgot to tag the person for whatever reason. I said to Otis that there will be other pictures where he would be tagged and that is also resolved. Behind closed doors without the media, because that is how things are resolved anyway,” he said.
