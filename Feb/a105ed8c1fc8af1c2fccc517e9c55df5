Controversial media personality Khanyi Mbau’s Ubusuku Bonke explicit details are aimed at reintroducing the artist. “It is explicit because I wanted to highlight who I really am and how I want my music to be, not what I have released in the past. I need people to know the real Khanyi, not who they always thought they knew,” Mbau told Sunday World. The Shake hitmaker said she started working on the song in 2016 but it was rejected and censored by the Mabala Noise director Reggie Nkabinde, who preferred that she join the
dance genre space in the music industry. Four years later, the song serves as a comeback, showing Mbau as a different character who is into romantic ballads. In reclaiming her dignity, the artist said she was also working on a reality TV show. “People don’t know who I really am because someone on Twitter once asked if I even have parents. I do and I am very different from them. I’m ready to show people the real Khanyi,” said Mbau. By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
