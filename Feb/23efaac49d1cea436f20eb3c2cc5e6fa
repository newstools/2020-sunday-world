Nandi, Zamani Mbatha aim to grow Isithembiso co-stars Nandi and Zamani Mbatha are on a mission to grow their acting careers despite being left out in the cold after Mzansi Magic confirmed the cancellation of the drama series. Speaking to Sunday World this week, Nandi, who is not related to Zamani, said she had not bagged any other acting gigs, but believed in pushing the envelope. “I’m also working on my craft more, trying to perfect it for international gigs. I’m constantly gunning to be the best I can be for myself, nothing ever happens in the comfort zone,” she said. Meanwhile Zamani, who is international actor Nomzamo Mbatha’s younger brother, said he was devastated about the show coming to an end. Isithembiso announced last year in October that the telenovela would not be renewed for a fourth season. Nandi, who played the role of Simi while Zamani played his namesake Zamani, shot to stardom when the Bomb Production Company searched for two young actors who would grow with the show. Nandi said she had always tried to maintain her “good girl” reputation, especially since her character was a wholesome young lady from rural KwaZulu-Natal, but noted she was not Simi. “I’m not living in her shadows. Her reality isn’t mine and I’m becoming better and better at separating from her. I love her to bits though, she is my first child,” she chuckled. She has since scored a modelling partnership with fashion designer Quiteria to showcase most of his Quiteria Atelier collections. Zamani said he had grown to understand the gruelling entertainment industry with all its ups and downs. He confirmed he had scored a Netflix drama series deal that features the likes of Anga Makubalo and Candice Modiselle. By Nokuthula Zwane
