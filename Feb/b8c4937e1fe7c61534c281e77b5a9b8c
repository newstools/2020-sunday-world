Measures taken to fix judging process The South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) are bringing “credibility” back to the judging process. Makhosazana Khanyile, CEO of the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF), said the love for South African talent was certainly in the air and their priority was work on the
feedback from previous Saftas. “A key priority for us this year was to bring credibility back to the Safts’ judging process. “It is no secret that many production companies have voiced their frustration with our appraisal system, some going as far as to boycott the Saftas altogether,” Khanyile said. “Having taken this feedback to heart, we’ve taken every measure possible to ensure that the judging process is fair, transparent and without bias. Today I’m proud to announce that as a result of these efforts, we’ve received over 300 entries for the Saftas.” It’s the battle of the drama series, with The River, Isibaya and Lockdown making the cut for the 2020 Saftas. The announcement of the nominees was made at the Mall of Africa in Midrand on Friday morning. Leading this year’s nominations is popular telenovela The River, which raked in 15 nominations across numerous categories. Actress Sindi Dlathu secured a nomination for best actress in the genre, while Presley Chweneyagae was nominated in the best actor category. Close on its heels was the soapie Isibaya, television drama Lockdown season 4 and the feature Film Fiela se Kind, which all clinched 11 nominations each. Drama series The Republic rounded things off  with 10 nominations. By Nokuthula Zwane
