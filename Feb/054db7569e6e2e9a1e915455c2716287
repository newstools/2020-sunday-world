The Bachelor SA will not see your typical South African man – at least not for now. Sunday World and various members of the media invited to the M-Net FastForward showcase in Sun City this week were told that ‘no one wants to see a man with a boop’. The controversial comment was made by M-Net head of local content and independent films Kaye-Ann Williams. Williams went out to say that the producers of the dating show wanted a candidate who was aspirational. This year, the show announced its Bachelor Marc Buckner, a tree hugging travel fanatic from Cape Town. Williams, who was asked if the show addressed the issue of race and having a cast that was picture perfect, said: “it is important for us to cast someone who is good looking or is appealing.” She later contradicted herself by saying that there was no written criteria to the type of Bachelor the show was looking for. Williams said she was aware of the typical South African man, but said because the show was still new in the country, they would like to ask for time to grow its audience. Head of Publicity, Lani Lombard told Sunday World this year’s show was diverse with the women selected. “Once there have been more season of the Bachelor SA the better,” said Lombard. Executive Producer, Donald Clarke said: “In terms of race it’s absolutely something that we speak about as a production team and discuss what the realities are happening in the country. Our entire editorial team is Very diverse.” This season only 22 contestants instead of 24 will be in the running for a final rose for the Bachelors heart. Three contestants have already been made public, and they are radio personality Nolo Phiri , 26-year-old UCT Masters student and sister to Phumzile Van Damme, Qiniso. The rest of the cast will be revealed on Friday night on M-Net. By Nokuthula Zwane
