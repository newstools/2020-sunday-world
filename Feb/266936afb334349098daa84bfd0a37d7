Moja Love reality star Alfie Mahlangabeza has revealed that his marriage to celebrity gay polygamist Enoch Kolobe was one of dictatorship. Speaking to Sunday World, he said he left his ex-husband early last year as they did not see eye to eye. “I felt I was not being appreciated in the relationship. I also felt there was deep-rooted differences between us as I’m from the north and he is very rural so he was not meeting me
halfway. In my view he came across as a dictator and I think that was his love language but because we are different, I did not get it.” Kolobe, a controversial pastor of Zion Apostolic Church Brother Mission, had three gay partners whom he called his “wives” on the reality show Umdeni last year. The show was cancelled after one season. Mahlangabeza, also known as Gogo Majabula as he is a practising sangoma, said his life has changed drastically since being on the popular Moja Love show, and that he did not know that his “life story and marriage would attract a lot of interest”. Mahlangabeza, who is now seeing someone else, said he was done with the polygamist lifestyle and his eyes were set on one person. Kolobe did not respond to calls or texts at the time of publication.
