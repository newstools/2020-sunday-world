Photographer made to beg for R1 500 after shoot House music producer and songwriter TNS was labelled a bad payer by his photographer after he failed to pay for a shoot. TNS, real name Nkazimulo Ngema, allegedly hired Mohau Solane from MB Views Photography for an outdoor shoot on November 15 last year and promised to pay R1 500 for the project. Solane said he had expected that his work would not reach the public eye before he was paid, but he said some of his pictures have been seen circulating on the musician’s social media platforms to promote his latest hit single Umona. “Not so long ago he was complaining that he’s being taken advantage of, now he’s doing the same. I did media work for him in 2019 and he hasn’t paid me yet. And worse, he’s ignoring my calls,” he said. TNS, however, disputed claims of a full photo shoot. He said he had known of one photo taken by Solane but said it could not be worth R1 500. He said he doubted Solane was the one after him. “I think there is someone else who is behind all this because it doesn’t make sense why someone would be so angry over R1 500.” By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
