Prophet Shepard Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Church (ECG) in Pretoria was set alight on Wednesday night.  According to the leader of the church, they together with fire extinguishers and the Fire department managed to act on time. He released a statement on his social media account which reads in part: This is to inform the general public that last night some people attempted to burn down our two main tents which we use as our overflow at Pretoria Showgrounds.” He said they hoped that police investigations would reveal who had tried to burn down the church so that justice could be served. “As a church, we will continue in prayer, asking God to keep protecting us and, also, to shame and expose those who want to destroy the church He built. I have been persecuted – together with my church – and survived their bullets and cheap media propaganda. This too, shall pass.” Staff Reporter
