Consistency is the name of the game. So say Orlando Pirates veterans because they know a thing or two about winning a league title with the Buccaneers as they look ahead to the end of the season. Kaizer Chiefs are still enjoying the limelight at the top of the league log. Mamelodi Sundowns lie second, with Super- Sport United perched third and Pirates in fourth place before yesterday’s games. The league title race is gett­ing tighter with each round of the remaining 10 before the 2019/20 league campaign curtain falls. The possibility of another trophyless season for Bucs has inspired the players to go after the PSL title. Pirates have not won a major trophy since their 2014 Nedbank Cup win and last tasted league success in the 2011/12 season. Sunday World spoke to a few Bucs legends, who believe their former club is still in contention to win the league: GOODMAN MAZIBUKO “Pirates are not in a bad position but they have to double their effort going to the home straight. They must use every corner kick, every throw-in and every set-piece to their advantage,” said the former QwaQwa Stars and Moroka Swallows captain, who was a Bucks midelder in 2002/03. “It’s towards the end of the season, the legs are starting to tell, you can see by the number of goals scored – 1-0, 2-1. So it will be up to the coach and the players to show individual brilliance. And most importantly, show hunger to want to win the league.”  ANDRIES SEBOLA The legendary Bucs striker, who started matches from the bench as a super sub, often getting a goal or two, said that to catch up to Chiefs, Pirates must show consistency by beating the top teams. He feels they must win the derby against Chiefs and the matches against Sundowns and Wits, but “must not think about winning the league at this stage”. “It will be crucial for Pirates to stay focused on winning all their remaining matches and getting maximum points so as to catch up with the top three teams. Chiefs have been relatively consistent. They should also pin their hopes on the top teams losing points on the way to the finishing line of the marathon league title race.” WILLEM JACKSON Jackson, who was a Bucs defender from 1996 to 2004, also put emphasis on consistency. “To be consistent in the last few matches remaining, Pirates players have to work hard. Not only Chiefs, Sundowns and SuperSport are in the running. You cannot discount Wits, they are also very much in the reckoning,” said Jackson, who now coaches the Highlands Park Diski Challenge reserve side. By Xolile Mtshazo
