Brand SA is proud to bring to South Africa our Play Your Part programme, a nation-wide initiative aimed at inspiring, empowering and celebrating active citizenship in the
country. Play Your Part is for everyone. It encourages all South Africans to use some of their time, money, skills or goods to contribute to a beer future for all. This week, Brand SA was joined by Play Your Part ambassadors, comedy trio Donavan, Jason and Nicholas Goliath of Goliath and Goliath, at Sophumelela High School in Mitchells Plain in the Western Cape. We engaged with learners from Phakama and Zisukhanyo secondary schools on how to “Play Your Part and turn your ideas into currency,” to empower them to become active in their
communities and make a difference in the lives of those around them. Together, we can build a positive Nation Brand through Play Your Part, so join us and learn how you too can Play Your Part. -Sponsored content
