Whether you agree or not – your opinion no longer matt­ers – the one that ma­ers is that of the Boxing Writers Association of America, which has declared that wealthy, flamboyant and arrogant American boxer Floyd “Money” Mayweather Jnr is the Fighter of the Decade. The Boxing Writers Association of America made it official last week that Mayweather is their first ever Joe Louis Fighter of the Decade winner. He topped the Forbes and Sports Illustrated lists of the 50 highest-paid athletes of 2012 and 2013, and the Forbes list again in both 2014 and 2015, listing him as the highest- paid athlete in the world. Mayweather is one of the most lucrative pay-per-view a­ractions of all time in any sport. His net worth is $565-million (R8.5-billion) and he earns $300-million a fight. He is the first $1-billion fighter. Mayweather, 42, held multiple world titles in five weight division and the lineal championships in four weight categories (twice at welterweight) and retired with an undefeated record of 50 fights. He was trained by his father Floyd Mayweather Snr and his brother Roger. He was quoted saying: “I’m honoured to be recognised by the media who covered my career throughout its many decades. “Boxing has been a part of my life since I was two years old and I dedicated my life to it and gave it my all. I trained hard, showed up for every one of my fights and did my job successfully each and every time. “To retire undefeated and achieve what I did in the sport is not only a gift to myself, but to the fans and, most importantly, my team and family. I certainly didn’t do it alone and I appreciate anyone who played a part in it.” Many sporting news and boxing websites ranked him as the best pound for pound boxer in the world twice in a span of 10 years.
