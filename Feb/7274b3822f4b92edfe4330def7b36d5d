“As’phelelanga” hitmaker Vusi Nova escaped a near death experience while driving to OR Tambo airport, this morning. Vusinova whose real name is Vusimuzi Nongxa revealed on his social media that he had been involved in a hectic car accident at 7:05 am on the N3 South just before the Modderfontein offramp.  The singer who was driving alone in his white Mercedes-Benz Viano said he lost control of the car , and skid towards a nearby fence. He told Sunday World he blames the rain for the accident, because the road was slippery and made it hard for him to control the car. “It rolled and by the grace of God, I don’t have even a single scratch. Grateful to be alive.” On Twitter he alerted his followers to be extra vigilant on the road especially with the wet rain.  “God is good all the time! ….This is proof that there’s so much I still need to do before it’s my time. Guys plz be careful on the roads (rain) grateful to be alive (sic),” wrote Nongxa. A source close to Vusinova said she was still shocked about the news stating that she was looking forward to his upcoming show, Evening of Love. “He called us , and said, ‘I almost died’. Jokingly. We thought he was joking too, until we saw the video,” said the source. It is unclear which flight he was meant to catch.  Vusinova who is signed to Muthaland, a record label owned by Lance Stehr, is currently in preparation for his upcoming two day Evening of Love showcase on Valentines day.
