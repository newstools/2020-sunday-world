Winnie Khumalo’s daughter, Rethabile, is basking in the glory of the single hit Umlilo. The song, made popular by DJ Zinhle, features the 25-year-old vocalist and was a massive hit last year, winning song of the year. In a video shared on social media earlier this month, a preacher was seen encouraging the congregation to listen to DJ Zinhle on the song, which had a powerful Christian message, referring to Isaiah 35 in the Bible. Speaking to Sunday World this week, Rethabile said she was now prioritising unconventional gospel music through the guidance of her mother. “I am trying to bring the youth to God through my music and Umlilo was a start,” she said. “I want to bring the youth back to loving God because there are times when songs today are about all the sinful things happening around us, like love, hustle or drugs,” she explained. The Nomathemba singer said she had not been a hectic churchgoer growing up but things changed as the musician grew older. She broke out into the music industry when she auditioned for Idols twice until she made it to the top 16 in 2016. In 2018, she signed on to DJ Tira’s record label, Afrotainment, for a one-song contract for the single Nomathemba. She is now an independent artist at Winnkay Records, co-owned by
her mother. Plans for an album, expected to be released next month, are in the pipeline. By Nokuthula Zwane
