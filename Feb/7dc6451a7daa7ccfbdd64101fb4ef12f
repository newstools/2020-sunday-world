Department opens a case of fraud against two state accountants for tempering with the department’s account The Limpopo department of health has suspended two officials attached to its salary section on allegations of fraud after an amount of R140 000 meant for leave gratuity was fraudulently paid to accounts owned by family members of the employees. The details emerged after news broke that a state accountant at the department had been paying a monthly salary of about R50 000 to his girlfriend. According to sources privy to the matter, the same accountant was said to have also helped himself to the department’s R175 000 which he allegedly paid to his girlfriend as a bonus. Departmental Spokesman Neil Shikwambana confirmed in a statement that two officials were suspended pending an investigation into a case of alleged fraud involving payments made from the department’s accounts. However, he could not confirm if the beneficiaries of the payments were girlfriends of the officials. “The two are suspected to have fraudulently paid a substantial amount for leave gratuity to accounts suspected to be of non deserving beneficiaries. The department has opened a case of fraud with the SAPS,” said Shikwambana. Despite this incident, Shikwambana said the department had put systems in place to prevent fraud and corruption , and early detection whenever they occur as part of maintaining its stance on xero tolerance on fraud and corruption.
