Media personality, business woman and original “Champopo Queen”, Bonang Matheba unveiled a new champagne to her beverage brand House of BNG at the Sun Met 2020 on Saturday. Matheba arrived at the Sun Met, Kenilworth Racecourse in flamboyant style, flanked by two uniformed butlers carrying her Prestige Reserve , creating an event in itself. The beverage drinkers will have to wait for a month before it will be available in stores. As the “face” of Sun Met 2020, styled in a gorgeous couture gown, her presence generated a particular glamour and buzz where some of the finest fashionistas  such as Nandi Mbatha, Linda Mtoba and Sarah Langa strutted in high-style.   ..
