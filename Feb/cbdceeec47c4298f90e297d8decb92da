South Africa’s largest black-empowered resource company, Exxaro, signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday with Bell Equipment Sales South Africa to enhance the offering of its enterprise and supplier development. Exxaro CEO Mxolisi Mgojo said the partnership is aimed at giving its contractors access to mining equipment at affordable rates. Mgojo said Exxaro recognised the role contractors played in enabling its success, as well as the challenges they faced. “Partnering with Bell, therefore, better positions Exxaro to deliver on their goal of contributing to the country’s economy while addressing the needs of their communities,” said Mgojo. Exxaro’s supplier development initiative intends to promote economic transformation through developing entrepreneurs and supplier, and creating competitive markets for
them to generate more jobs. Exxaro has a diversified portfolio of assets and a solid resource base. It is one of the largest supplier of coal to the national power utility, Eskom. Eighty percent of its coal is sold/ to domestic markets, with the balance sold internationally. Bell Equipment’s sales and distribution subsidiary is 51% black owned and 30% black women owned, while the manufacturing entity is 51% black owned and 15% black women
owned. In addition, as a major local manufacturer, Bell is a sizeable employer and contributor to the local economy, supporting more than 900 suppliers throughout South Africa.
Its MD Duncan Mashika said the company was excited with the deal because it provided Exxaro and its contractors with a win-win solution. “As a local company, we understand the challenges facing contractors and are eager to assist them in accessing quality equipment that best meets their needs and helping them
to achieve the most from their Bell ownership experience,” Mashika said. By Kabelo Khumalo
