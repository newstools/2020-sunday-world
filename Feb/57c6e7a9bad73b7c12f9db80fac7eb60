 Richard has been the Managing Director of the Hirsch’s Group for the last eight years. He takes over the reins from his father, Allan, who has moved into the position of joint Chairman of Hirsch’s together with his wife Margaret – previously Chief Operations Officer of the company. Allan said the company was doing well at the moment and was happy that the group’s succession plan had fallen in place with Richard’s appointment. “We are proud to be the number one independent retailer in SA and look forward to the new opportunities that a new team brings,” Allan said. He added that Paul Brown, who has been part of the Management team for the past 15 years at Hirsch’s, has replaced Richard as managing director.
