Kudos to the panel of judges that sat down and had a robust debate and selection process that has led us to this coveted list of really talented individuals who will for the first time be acknowledged for the work they have put in over so many years. We at the BVSM are delighted to contribute towards opening up the industry and recognising members of the industry that have been overlooked for so long. We are thankful for the support we have received from our sponsors and we look forward to an amazing show befitting a musical celebration of this magnitude,” said Chaka Chaka: A unique feature of the BVSM is that winners walk away with R5 000 cash on the day and an endowment policy of R20 000 will be opened for the future well being and welfare of each winner.
