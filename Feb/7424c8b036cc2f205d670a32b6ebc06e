The coronavirus is no damper for the producers of international reality Survivor South Africa. This is confirmed by  executive producers Handrie Basson and Leroux Botha during the popular reality show media launch in Sun City this week. “The coronavirus is something that we monitor at every level at this point in time,” said Basson. Under the theme Immunity Island, the producers who are in the planning stages of the show, said that the world epidemic might halt decisions to take the show to areas that are prone to the virus. “Unless there is a complete shutdown of international travel we are still looking into where the castaways will be living,” said Basson. However, he declined to reveal where season eight of the show will be shot. Basson added that the show was working with various local and international authorities to investigate the health risks in shooting the show on the islands on their planning list. Entries for the show were opened in December and closed in January 20, 2020. Basson added: “If you love watching Survivor, if you have shouted at the TV in frustration and admiration and if you have said ‘I can do this!’ or if you have thought ‘I will never do that!’… then it’s time to get off the couch and onto the island.” By Nokuthula Zwane
