EFF MPL and provincial chairperson Matshidiso Botswe and other members were forcefully removed from the provincial legislature after they were accused by the speaker of attempting to disrupt Premier Job Mokgoro’s State of Province Address. Their removals has also led to two members of the public, who are also EFF members assaulted by what looked like Legislature security who were clad in shinny suits. The scuffle between the EFF members and the security allegedly began after Botswe was involved in verbal confrontation with the Speaker about NCOP member China Dodovu’s statements which he uttered from the gallery as an invited guests.  Botswe told Sunday World security officials kicked them with their shoes and also pushed them against the pillars of the building while they did not fight back. “The scuffle started after they were removing me from the chambers because I suggested that we seek advise from somewhere about the rules of the legislature. She started accusing me, saying that I want to disrupt the sitting, and she ordered that members of the SAPS and security must remove and other members,” said Botswe. The provincial EFF leader said he and two other EFF members who were assaulted during the incident were opening cases of assault against the officers and security at Mmabatho police station. He said he sustained injuries on his arm, while other members were bleeding from their noses. By Aubrey Mthombeni
