Mfenyane is last of Mabuzas set to leave Former Generations actress Zenande Mfenyane is allegedly set to be stripped of her Queenship by the Fergusons, allegedly after it was discovered that she had a bun in the oven. Goodness, as Mfenyane is known in the soapie, The Queen, is the last member of the Mabuza family on the Fergusons’ production set, and is believed to be earmarked to leave following the departure of Setumo Motsoaledi, who played the character of Mmabatho and one of the main actors Rami Chuene, who played the popular of T-Gom. According to two cast members close to the production, Mfenyane was set to be written out of the soapie after the show’s producers, the Fergusons, struggled to incorporate
her reported pregnancy into the storyline. One of the cast members said that while Mfenyane was yet to be informed, she seems to have known that the writing was on the wall, especially after the dismantling of the Mabuza family, where her character was anchored. The sources said despite Goodness currently enjoying a strong showing with her character, they said there wasn’t anything tangible she would be doing after the funeral of her mother T-Gom, who will be shot dead at her restaurant by Skhumbuzo’s wife. Mfenyane has dismissed these details as untrue when contacted, stating that there was nothing like that. She said she was not pregnant and was not leaving The Queen. The Fergusons failed to respond to questions sent to them last month. By Aubrey Mothombeni
