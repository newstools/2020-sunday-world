Radio 2000 presenter David Mashabela has released his last  interview with Chilli M on his new radio legends focused podcast studio. This was announced during the launch of his radio podcast King David Studio at Melrose Arch yesterday. In the podcast, the former Massiv Metro presenter, real name Vukani Masinga, who recently died of natural causes, chronicles the story of his life, from birth to his last days on radio. “He had given me a call after we had done the podcast and asked that I release his first. I asked him why and he said he was hoping that he would be able to get a job again. Little did we know that a few days later he would leave us,” said Mashabela. In the podcast, which Sunday World heard, Chill M explained that he was part of the blueprint of various radio stations such as YFM, Nandos Heatwave, Metro, East Coast Radio and Ukhozi FM. “At Nando’s I was on peri-peri fire mode. I was like chilli. And this is it maan, I need to get into the mainstream because my peers were buying cars… I was snooping myself day in day out. I was listening to my projections,” said Chill M. Chill M explained that he was always labelled as a ‘bad boy’. The former Metro FM radio jockey added that the stardom of working at SABC got to his head. “If I look at my life today it was just plain and simple stupidity,” said Chill M. The podcasts, which are one hour long talk show interviews with South African radio legends , are the reflection on their life stories and their views on life and love.
