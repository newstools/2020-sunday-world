Embattled state-owned entities South African Airways (SAA) and SABC were handed a lifeline by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to the tune of billions. Mboweni said the SABC will be given R1.1 billion and SAA will receive R16.4 billion. Government in December took a drastic step when it placed SAA under business rescue as the national carrier struggled to keep its planes in the sky. The airline’s business rescue practitioners are expected to table their turnaround next week. However the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association yesterday warned that they could stop SAA’s Business Rescue. Practitioners from submitting their business rescue plan if union members are not consulted as part of the process. The business rescue practitioners have already taken unpopular steps in their pursuit to turnaround the airline that has not made a profit since 2011. The business rescue practitioners raised the ire of the South Africans when they cut trips to Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth. By Kabelo Khumalo
