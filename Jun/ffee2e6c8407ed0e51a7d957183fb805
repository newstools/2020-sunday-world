The National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) satellite office in Tzaneen is the latest institution to be affected by  COVID-19 virus after an employee tested positive for virus. The organization said the Tzaneen office will resume its normal operations on 6 July 2020. NHBRC acting CEO Otsile Maseng said developers, contractors, home builders and housing consumers in the area are advised to use the Polokwane or Thulamela offices. “As part of our precautionary measures, all the affected employees based in that office will also be in self-isolation for 14 days, as per the COVID-19 regulations,” said Maseng. “Each of our offices has established a COVID-19 task team to ensure the continued safety of our employees and customers, and all visiting our offices are requested to cooperate with the measures put in place,” concluded Maseng.
