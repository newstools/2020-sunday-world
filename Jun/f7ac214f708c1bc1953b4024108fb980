 Deputy Correctional Services Minister Phathekile Holomisa has recovered from the novel coronavirus. Holomisa was back at work and was expected to participate in a parliamentary session today. He said that his recovery should not induce complacency on the part of the population, as the country moves towards the peak of the infections from the virus, which is a global pandemic. “It is vital that every citizen continue to fully adhere to, and diligently implement, protective measures in order to stop the spread of the virus,” said Holomisa. He was one of the prominent politicians who tested positive for the coronavirus. Trade unionist Zwelinzima Vavi also recovered from the disease. This comes as the number of people infected increased to 144 264, an increase of 6 130 cases from yesterday. Deaths related to the virus rose to 2529, which was an increase of 73 from last night. Elderly people between the ages of 60-69 accounted for most of the deaths (26,4%), followed by those aged between 50-59 (23,8%), while people aged between 70-79 accounted for 17,9% of the deaths.
