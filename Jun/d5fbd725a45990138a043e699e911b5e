Raggae and dancehall musician, Bongo Riot, has had to put his music on the back burner for a nine to five job. The former Gang of Instrumental band member, whose real name is Mphikheli Zungu is now a “miner.” He has taken on the role of an engineering services and maintenance miner at Murray and Roberts cementation. The musician said this decision was the result of financial constraints. “My life has been one great experience..I have been on the highest and lowest life lessons, along the way I picked up some lifetime responsibilities which will not divorce me. Like big family, children and [being a] breadwinner to the rest of my family,” he explained. “I had to work in the deep mines in order to financially compensate for my music career and fulfill my roles and responsibilities,” he shared.
