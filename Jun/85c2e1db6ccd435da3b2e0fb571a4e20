Jub Jub proved this week dogs and black people are not the best of friends, and that Afrikaans never loved us. He took on some vicious women at Eldorado Park’s “playboy mansion”. And it was “she’s not lagging, he’s lagging”. The Uyajola 9/9 host also gave us a new perspective on what the word Nunu means. Kudos to the brave investigator. Shwashwi
