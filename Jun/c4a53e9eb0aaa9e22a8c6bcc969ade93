   Pitch Black Afro, who was facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice, has been found guilty of culpable homicide when he appeared in the  Joburg Hgh Court on Thursday June 18. Handing down  his judgement, Judge J. Du Plessis said he could not find that the rapper intentionally killed his wife Catherine Modipane because both of them were heavily intoxicated on the day of her death.  Du Plessis said the rapper Pitch Black Afro, real name Thulani Ngcobo, had negligently caused her death. He said he did this by forcefully pushing her against the wall of the house after an argument. She died of blunt force trauma to her head. The judge said the rapper’s argument made during the trial, that he was forced to confess to the murder, did hold some water as he also confirmed during his evidence that he indeed pushed her against the wall of the room they were in. He said the rapper was angry with the deceased, and he committed his actions out of anger. However, he said Ngcobo ought to have known that his actions might lead to her death. “The accused is therefore found guilty of culpable homicide and not murder. He is found not guilty on count 2,” said the judge. Pitch Black Afro was facing two charges, one for murder and defeating the ends of justice. According to IOL news website, the artist will be sentenced tomorrow ( Friday, June 19).
