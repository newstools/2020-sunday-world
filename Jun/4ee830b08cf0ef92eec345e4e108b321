Boity Thulo must rather quit this rap thing while she is ahead. Her latest track, Own Your Throne, is gemors. Same like Abdul Khoza is on some rapper swag lately, with a new single called Run.   There are some things certain industry folk need to avoid, and that is to force matters. The song is a flop. Forget it, tu!
