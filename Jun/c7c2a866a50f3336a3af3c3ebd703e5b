‘Jerusalem’ collaboration on the cards for two stars Award-winning musician Master KG has featured Africa’s music heavyweight Burna Boy on the remix of his track. The two respected artists are working on the remix of Master KG’s track called Jerusalem, which has taken YouTube by storm with over 35-million views. Master KG, real name Kgaogelo Moagi, said he was only toying with the idea of featuring Burna Boy on the remix of the song but was excited to hear through his Open Mic record label team that coincidentally, the artist also enquired about the remix of the song. The Skeleton Move hitmaker said the news was a dream come true for him as he looks up to Burna Boy. “I love his music because that’s what I follow a lot, his singing and his live show performances attract me a lot,” he said. “The advantages of working with him include that he has reached a level I am still working towards, so featuring him will expose me to a lot of people, including his market, which is obviously bigger than mine. People who didn’t know me will get to know me more.” Master KG said that this was an opportunity for him to make his mark on the African continent. Jerusalem will be released next month. The release date, however, has not yet been confirmed.
