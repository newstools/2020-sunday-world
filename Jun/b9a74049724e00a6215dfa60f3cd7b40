Lead vocalist wants to pursue a solo career Labantwana AmaUber lead vocalist Sicelo “Miano” Sikhosana has parted ways with his management company, Jozi Entertainment. Sunday World has learnt that Miano decided to walk away from the management company and fellow platinum-selling vocalists – Semi Tee and Kammu Dee (real names Tumelo Ramaila and Kamohelo Duma) to work on his solo career. According to sources close to the vocalist, there was no dispute but he decided to leave and be on his own. “The management’s vision was to grow all three to be brands at once. They were never a group. It’s just an individual decision he took and we wish him luck in the entertainment industry,” said an insider. Miano is popularly known for his quirky style of saying “Yebo” on most songs produced by the trio, especially on singles such as SiyaTrenda, featuring Cassper Nyovest, and Gabadiya. Another insider who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation said: “There were a few issues that led to him leaving. He somehow felt sidelined, especially because they were never an official group. “Right now, you’ll have to do it separately because he is on his own, doing his thing. You can’t book them as a trio because Semi Tee and Kammu Dee are under Jozi Entertainment, while Miano is independent.” Miano confirmed the break-up but stressed that he was never signed to the management company. “I did not change management though, I’m still exploring my options. There is no bad blood among us and I do confirm that we still have a good working relationship,” said Miano. Owner of Jozi Entertainment and Abuti PR Lebo Mlangeni confirmed the departure and said Miano’s decision was not going to affect any bookings or performances that demanded all three vocalists to perform together. “He left willingly and I’m not holding it against him. When it comes to bookings, it wouldn’t be a train smash, we’ve performed without Miano in the past,” said Mlangeni. Nokuthula Zwane
