 Award-winning musician Sjava showed off his humanitarian side when he told a fan he does not charge talented musicians. The Umama hit-maker was responding to an upcoming rapper, Kidd the smart rat, who posted: “@Sjava_atm it pained me to see you being dragged down but I am your biggest fan. I would like to work with you but I don’t have money though I have the best African trap sound. [It] would be the best moment jumping on the sound I got for you.” But Tweeps were excited to hear the Zulu artist did not charge to have his famous voice on someone’s track. “I don’t charge for features as long as you’re talented, respectful, passionate and proving that your music can make a difference in communities then we will work,” said Sjava.
