 The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) government has increased King Goodwill Zwelithini’s annual budget by a cool R4.5 million for the 2020/21 financial year, taking the king’s revenue from the government to more than R70 million. KZN premier Sihle Zikalala said the money will fund the maintenance of royal Palaces, the monarch’s traditional and cultural events among other expenses. “The role of the Zulu monarchy as a key institution in a democratic dispensation is well recognized by the Provincial government. In the 6th administration, the monarch still plays a crucial role in supporting government programs and preserving culture. In 2020/2021, the King Support and Royal House Branch has been allocated R71, 344 million,” Zikalala said. “The King and Royal House support comes in the form of coordination and management of His Majesty’s traditional and cultural events, providing logistical services and the maintenance of Royal Palaces. The support also includes support to the King’s agricultural activities, looking after the well-being of the Royal House through the KZN Zulu Royal House Trust.” The King’s annual budget amounts to almost R200 000 a day. Zwelithini’s annual budget was increased by R65.8 million in 2018 to R66.7 million in the 2019/20 financial year.
