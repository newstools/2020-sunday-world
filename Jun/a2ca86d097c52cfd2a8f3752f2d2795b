Rambada charged with intimidation A member of the mayoral committee in Limpopo has been arrested after he sent a video of a shooting gun to two mayors immediately after he got fired from his position. The ANC politician, Ndivhuho Radamba, now faces two counts of intimidation after Vhembe  district executive mayor Dowelani Nenguda, and mayor of Thulamela, Avhashoni Tshifhango, opened cases against him at Thohoyandou police station. Tshifhango said he was still shocked by the incident. “For some reason, the guy thinks that me and the executive mayor influenced his removal from his position. I don’t know how I did that, because I don’t even work at the district,” said Tshifhango.   Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed Radamba’s arrest in a statement yesterday, saying that the suspect had sent an intimidatory video to two mayors after a council sitting. “The police subsequently received information on the suspect’s whereabouts after he was reported to be somewhere in Polokwane and swiftly followed it up. The suspect was then apprehended at his house in Polokwane this morning,” said Mojapelo. He said Radamba will appear at Thohoyandou magistrate’s court tomorrow.
