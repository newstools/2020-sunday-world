The PSL transfer window period closes on Friday and the league’s offices in Parktown are expected to be a hive of activity as clubs rush to meet the registration deadline. It is uncertain whether Kaizer Chiefs central midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase is staying put or leaving Amakhosi after failing to secure game time this season under coach Ernst Middendorp. Amakhosi con­firmed the signing of Kenyan international Anthony Akumu. The defensive midfielder was previously on the books of Zambian champions Zesco United. Club Brugge in Belgium, home to Bafana’s Percy Tau, have made a R30-million offer for Orlando Pirates striker Thembinkosi Lorch but it was rejected. Lorch has now been linked to Besiktas in Turkey. Mamelodi Sundowns are confident that they can secure the signature of Knowledge Musona of Anderlecht in Belgium. Attacking midfielder Siphelele Magubane has moved to AmaZulu on a three-year deal from Golden Arrows. Striker Milos Lacny has signed for AmaZulu while Polokwane City have registered Chiefs attacking midfielder Kabelo Mahlasela. Down in the Eastern Cape, Chippa United have secured the signature of Sundowns striker Thokozani Sekotlong and mi­dfielder Thabiso Lebitso. Bidvest Wits have snatched Cameroonian striker Bienvenu Eva Nga from Mozambique’s Costa do Sol and have released midfielder Granwald Scott to Stellenbosch. In Limpopo, relegation- threatened Baroka have recalled striker Ranga Chivariro, who was on loan at GladAfrica Championship side TS Sporting. Cape Town City realised their wish of having Baroka midfield strongman Mduduzi Mdantsane on their books after he was released last month.
