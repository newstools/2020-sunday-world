Mbalula’s response “The CEO head-hunting process was collaborative, but was later abandoned after a recommendation from the department that the interim
board was dysfunctional and traded Prasa recklessly. As far as my adviser’s duties go, advisers advise and produce thought products on various matt­ers. As such, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary if during the process of liaison, discussions were held about various topics. At no point was the interim board’s power of control or independence usurped by any person. The board and its leadership were simply not effective and placed the organisation at risk The chairperson of the interim board and I held discussions about all ma­tters concerning the agency. The head-hunting of GCEO for Prasa is not linked to the decision to dissolve the interim board. This board had long passed its term limit with various extensions provided without any material change to Prasa’s fortunes. In fact, the auditor-general, Rail Safety Regulator and standing commi­ttee on public accounts had red-flagged the board and its performance. The board was dissolved because of continued bad results and lack of good corporate governance.”
