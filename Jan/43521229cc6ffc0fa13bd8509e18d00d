Rapper Cassper Nyovest and his personal photographer, Jabu Nkosi, are frantically running around in search of the muso’s prized possession – his camera. A night out with friends turned sour when Nkosi lost his boss Casper’s camera in a cab in Cape Town last Sunday. According to Nyovest, his protege forgot the Canon EOS 6D camera worth over R40 000 in the maxi cab. “It wasn’t an Uber, so we can’t trace it. Eish, we need it back. So, it’s like 40kn for a new one,” he said. Speaking to Sunday World this week, Nkosi said an act of kindness after going out clubbing at Saint in Cape Town backfired on him. “I wasn’t alone at the time, there were a lot of people there. Everyone was leaving the club already.” “When we got to the hotel, I was helping a girl out of the car because she was intoxicated. She couldn’t even walk, I mean, I had to help her take off her shoes. As soon as I went into the hotel the guy drove away. I couldn’t even run after him or get the car registration.” Nyovest’s relationship with Nkosi kicked off when he shot an iconic #FillUp FNB Stadium picture in 2017 with over 60 000 people captured in one frame.   3 days ago 68,000 people helped one man achieve his dream… That dream now inspires us to reach our dreams A post shared by  Jabu Nkosi (@jabukiing) on Dec 4, 2017 at 11:42pm PST  On Nkosi’s birthday Cassper lauded him for the work well done. “The man behind the lens!!! All my pictures and videos are shot by this young man. Such a pleasure to work with …,” Nyovest tweeted. By Nokuthula Zwane
