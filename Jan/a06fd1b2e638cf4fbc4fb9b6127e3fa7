The SABC confirmed that Zaziwa, like many other programmes,  has been subjected to a review exercise for recommissioning  and its on the chopping block. “SABC programmes are subjected to a review exercise for recommissioning, with the intention of ensuring that the channels are able to deliver and become competitive platforms,” said SABC acting spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo.
