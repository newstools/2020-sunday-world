While matric results will be announced today, pupils from lower grades and university students may have already received their reports. The sad reality is that not everyone will progress to the next level or grade. But there is always a second chance. Students and pupils are advised to remember that no exam is worth their life. Failing a grade might be disappointing, but it can be used as a learning curve. There is no doubt that 2019 matriculants are currently suffering from anxiety amid the release of the results in January. Each year, many matriculants struggle to accept their results because of the high expectations they set for themselves. A bad outcome of the matric results can sometimes lead to young people committing suicide. Pretoria-based psychologist Thabang Tlaka said learners need to understand that failure is not fatal. The South African Depression and Anxiety Group has given learners tips on what to do if they fail. The tips include: • First check out the official printout of results not just what appears in the newspaper. • Speak to the headmaster at the school about their options, especially if they have only failed by a small margin or only failed one subject. • Ask for a remark on an exam, if so inclined. • Consider bridging courses where necessary. • Consider career counselling.
