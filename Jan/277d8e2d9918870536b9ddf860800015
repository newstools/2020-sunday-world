Mamelodi Sundowns star midfielder Andile Jali’s wife Nonhle Jali has been left with an egg on her face after bragging about her marriage to the top footie on social media. This after Nonhle posted an Instagram live video boasting about the tight relationship she has with Jali and announced that she was even has his bank cards in her possesion. In the video, the two are seen at a restaurant with Jali ignoring Nonhle rants while facing away, while she continues to diss anyone who might be after the footballer’s money. Nonhle said in the video: “Imagine me as the head office not having Peruvian hair with my normal hand platted hair and you think you are going to spend my husband’s money? You think you are going to have that Peruvian using my children’s nappy money? Never.” But the whole bragging episode saw the tables turned against her when Jali’s baby mama Dipuo Maloi commented on the matter. Maloi, who is now in a relationship with the Bloemfontein Celtics midfielder Lentshene Phalane, said the Jali marriage was still unstable and that she may keep the card after Jali has finally returned home. “A shitty head office, you are forward now that he has returned home… Keep the card girl, he still has a child outside of your unstable marriage (laughs) and he will still continue to F#@k out in the streets (bored). I wonder where’s the “Ghetto”?! “Your man is useless anyway, not even fit to be called a father, [he’s] just a sperm donor… He could hardly buy his firstborn child Christmas clothes, not even call or buy his child a gift on his birthday (bored). Ernest goes around picking up trash (laughs),” reads the post. By Boitumelo Kgobotlo
