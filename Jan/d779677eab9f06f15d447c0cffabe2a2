The demons that have haunted talented former Bafana Bafana‚ Orlando Pirates, Bournemouth FC and Cape Town City striker Tokelo Rantie have returned to plague him once again after current club Mamelodi Sundowns terminated his contract. Early this week, Sundowns announced the release of Rantie, citing his ill-discipline and going on leave without informing the club as the straw that broke the camel’s back. “Mamelodi Sundowns has terminated its contract with striker Tokelo Rantie with immediate effect,” the statement read. The former Bafana Bafana international and Bournemouth striker had gone Awol for a month and following an internal disciplinary process, the club terminated his contract. Rantie was signed by the Brazilians after spending a lengthy two-and-a-half months on trial at Chloorkop as he was given a chance to regain his tness and showcase his talent. “Despite the faith shown in him by head coach Pitso Mosimane and his technical team, Rantie’s discipline let him down and he failed to grab
the opportunity granted to him, especially since the Brazilians were needing a goal poacher of his calibre, considering that many of the strikers in the squad had been injured at some time or another.” Rantie joined Sundowns in September as a free agent but failed to make any official starts for the Brazilians. In 2018, he was in the footballing wilderness and was set for a second year without playing after Cape Town City released him from his contract. He had not played an official match for City as he was out of shape after returning from a failed spell in Turkey with Genclerbirligi before the start of the 2018/19 season. Mosimane gave him a break at the club last September. However, many in soccer circles questioned Mosimane’s wisdom in bringing Rantie to the club on a three-year deal, two months into the current season. By Xolile Mtshazo
