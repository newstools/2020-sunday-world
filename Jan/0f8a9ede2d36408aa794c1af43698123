Hip-hop superstar AKA and his baby mama DJ Zinhle have broke up – again. The two lovebirds, considered one of Mzansi’s IT couple, allegedly ended their romantic relationship in December following numerous disagreements about interference in their relationship. Sunday World can reveal that part of the two celebs disagreement emanated from DJ Zinhle’s partying with Cassper Nyovest at Saint Club in Cape Town, where she attended her beau’s nemesis’s celebration. According to sources close to AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, the rapper felt disrespected by his baby mama’s constant association with his enemy, and he allegedly confronted her. A source close to the pair revealed that the confrontation made matters worse as DJ Zinhle, real name Zinhle Jiyane, felt she was not answerable to AKA.

The source said another bone of contention between the rapper and his DJ baby mama was his relationship with his mother Lynn Forbes. It’s believed that AKA was also unhappy with his mother always taking DJ Zinhle’s side whenever they fought.   I miss you. A post shared by  ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Aug 31, 2019 at 8:36am PDT  The source also revealed AKA felt DJ Zinhle was using the fact she was seven years older to control him. The source said she was not listening to him and, as a result, he felt trapped. “He then decided that they should take a break from their relationship. But they talk,” said the source. AKA’s publicist, Pumza Nohashe, declined to comment as did DJ Zinhle. By Aubrey Mothombeni and Boitumelo Kgobotlo
