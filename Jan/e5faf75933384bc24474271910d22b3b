I think that is the highlight of this year … that we will be inviting people in and share a bit of us with them,” said Kekana. Mbhele explained that when his fiance fell into depression, he was not with him at the time. “Sad, even now, when I think about it, it still hurts me … When it happened I was home in KZN.
