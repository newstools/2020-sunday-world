The Estate Agency Affairs Board (EEAB) is set to get a new leadership after months of internal wrangling at the estate regulator. Human Selements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has instructed the outgoing board, chaired by Nkosinathi Biko, to prepare a handover report. This marks the end of an acrimonious relationship the board had with the EAAB’s CEO, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi. In September 2019, President Cyril Ramaphosa assented to the Property Practitioner’s Act, which expanded the mandate of the regulator and resulted in name change to Property Practitioners Regulatory Authority (PPRA). “I have, therefore, instructed the department to commence with the process for the appointment of the new board of the PPRA as provided for in section 7 of the act. The advert requesting nominations to serve on the Property Practitioners Regulatory Authority will be placed shortly in the Gazee and in media,” she said in a letter to Biko, dated April 28. Department’s spokesperson McIntosh Polela said Sisulu was still waiting for the report from Biko. Mohlala-Mulaudzi had a fraught relationship with one of the board members, Eugenia Kula-Ameyaw, whom she launched a R1.5-million defamation lawsuit against in December, after she questioned.
