Pearl Thusi, it was truly a blessing when you were off social media. Shwa wasn’t having unnecessary headaches. It hasn’t even been a moment and there you go, insulting one of the most beautiful women born, Jill Scott , on some you “wish you could powder her face”. Don’t ever cry again when people make fun of your pale skin. Nxh!
