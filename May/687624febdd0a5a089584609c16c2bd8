Comic book tackles issues of bullying in school and drugs, writes Somaya Stockenstroom Seven-year old Prince Mashawana grew tired of bullying and created a superhero in his image. Super Mash, the first black child fictional superhero who has now been made into a comic book, sold for R50 online and is steadily gaining popularity among Mzansi’s little tots. Super Mash looks almost identical to Prince. He wears a blue and orange costume with an orange cape . Prince says he created the character late last year and the idea was to build confidence in children. “I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I spoke and many other things. I would tell my family and that’s when I came up with the idea of Super Mash,” says Prince. “A superhero who will help other kids in need and his actions will build 100 more superhero’s. Maybe they will do the same and we will have a network of kids that are doing the best that they can to change the world, but it all starts with finding the strength within.” <img class=" wp-image-7240 aligncenter" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Super-mash-2-180x300.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="402" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Super-mash-2-180x300.jpg 180w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Super-mash-2-252x420.jpg 252w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Super-mash-2.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /> Rainbow Nation Comics, a South African comic book publisher that creates original, authentic and proudly South African superhero stories, partnered with Prince to make his concept professional. Prince worked with Phemelo Dibodu, story writer and editor, and Omphile Dibodu, illustrator and creative director. “It’s been a wonderful experience. We have no doubt Super Mash is going to have a very positive impact on his readers, and this comes as no surprise when you meet Prince himself,” said Phemelo. “He is a passionate and smart young man, and we think his social business idea is going to go a very long way in South Africa – to everyone’s benefit.” Prince said most kids like comic books and global superheros, but never really relate to them because they don’t reflect South African people. Prince adds that Super Mash tells stories of substance abuse, child abuse, homelessness, adoption, surviving your parents’ divorce, balancing schoolwork and extra-mural activities, bullying, discrimination, violence at school, unsafe housing and many other issues. They have already delivered comic books to many libraries around South Africa and have done school talks to build the confidence of the youth. “When we pretend to be super, it gives us a sense of control over a world that can seem big and scary.” Prince plans to have hundreds of comic books available over the next few years. He explains: “The long-term plan is to build a comic book set and series. We will follow the Marvel model and release a movie on the storyline of the comic books.” With the Covid-19 pandemic, Super Mash has also secured a sanitiser in his name, which he distributes to people in need. He has also just launched his YouTube channel called The Super Mash Show. The book is available on www.generationalwealtheducation.com.
