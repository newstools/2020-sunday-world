Lindiwe Sisulu, the minister of human settlements, water and sanitation has tapped the lead investigator, into the collapse and malfeasance into VBS Mutual Bank, Terry Motau to probe allegations of corruption in her department. Sisulu, in a statement, said Motau would spear the review of fraud and graft in the department of water and sanitation and water boards. “I have directed Adv Motau and a team that he is going to be working with. l want all reports on fraud, corruption and irregular expenditure of the Department and all Water Boards to be reviewed and all recommendations implemented. Officials and service providers involved in corruption must face the consequences” said Sisulu. “I received a report that more than R16 Billion worth of projects have been issued irregularly, including blanket corruption and fraud by officials, to an extent of awarding tenders to themselves and close relatives. This will not happen on my watch.” Motau gained public prominence after he led a forensic investigation into the VBS Mutual Bank, whose management siphoned nearly R2 billion from the bank – leading to its demise. The country’s water boards have hogged the headlines for all the wrong reasons in recent months. Sisulu this month placed Amatola Water Board, based in the Eastern Cape, under legal administration and its CEO on special precautionary leave. The department is also investigating allegations of irregular expenditure and governance issues at the Lepelle Northern Water, in Limpopo. However, both the Amatola and Lepelle CEOs have made counter corruption accusations against the Minister’s advisor Mphumzi Mdekazi – with the Lepelle CEO also accusing Sisulu of meddling in procurement matters – an allegation Sisulu has denied.
