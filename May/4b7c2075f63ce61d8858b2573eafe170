This lockdown is messing with people’s minds in many ways – just ask AKA. He had time to reflect on his childish, arrogant and insulting ways. In a live Instagram interview with Slikour this week he owned up, saying that swearing at Cassper was a mistake. Pity, it can’t be erased. But then he launches his channel, and his true narcissistic ways were again revealed. It costs a whole R50 subscription to watch his tantrums. Rather extra don’t you think?
