 Minister of Tourism Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane today announced the reappointment of Nkhumeleni Tharage as the department’s accounting officer for a new five-year term. Tharage will be charged with steering the department’s efforts to salvage the tourism sector from total collapse due to COVID-19. The industry which is dominated by small businesses has been one of the hardest-hit sectors due to both international and domestic travel restrictions aimed at slowing down the spread of the deadly virus. Kubayi-Ngubane said the industry is faced with possible business closures and a massive loss of jobs and that the magnitude of the crisis requires a sturdy hand at the helm. “I am personally very pleased that government and the sector have been able to retain a dedicated civil servant with his calibre, track record and further potential,” Kubayi-Ngubane said. “With his deep knowledge of tourism and experience, I believe that Mr Tharage is the best person to lead the department and the sector through the COVID-19 crisis and in the post-COVID-19 recovery period.” The Cyril Ramaphosa administration has identified tourism as one of the key sectors to grow the economy and create jobs.
