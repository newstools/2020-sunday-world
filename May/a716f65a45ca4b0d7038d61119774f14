Sultry television presenter Luthando “Lootlove” Shosha’s relationship with her boyfriend Sizwe “Reason” Moeketsi has petered out. This was announced by the former Live AMP presenter on social media yesterday. “Sizwe and I have separated, however, we continue to partner gracefully in raising our beautiful kids. I think anyone going through something this complex and painful, would understand why I wouldn’t want anyone to have a front row seat to my grieving & healing..,” she said. Lootlove also said that despite their separation, she and Reason remain friends and will collectively be raising their babygirls. “It is important to mention that Sizwe and I remain friends and really want to focus on raising our happy, healthy and loved up babygirls,” she said. The lanky presenter did not reveal the rationale behind their collapsed relationship and attempts by Sunday World to milk more information from them drew a blank.
