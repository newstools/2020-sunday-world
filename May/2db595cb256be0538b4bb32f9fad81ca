Financial services group Sasfin said today, businesswoman Gloria Serobe, has resigned from its board to focus on her role as chairperson of Solidarity Fund, set up by government to manage donations aimed at fighting COVID-19. The company said in a statement that Serobe has stepped down as the company’s non-executive director. “Shareholders are advised that Ms Gloria Serobe has, due to additional community commitments created by the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa, resigned from the Sasfin Board of Directors (“the Board”) with immediate effect.” President Cyril Ramaphosa tapped Serobe to head the Solidarity Fund in March as government moved to raise funds to aid its efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.  Ramaphosa said last night that the fund had raised nearly R3 billion so far. Serobe has had a distinguished business career having held senior positions in companies such as Exxon Corporation (USA), Reinsurance Company of SA, the Premier Group and Transnet. Serobe who holds an MBA from Rutgers University, also serves on the boards of WIPHOLD, Hans Merensky, Adcorp and Denel.  It was not immediately clear if she would be leaving those positions as well.
