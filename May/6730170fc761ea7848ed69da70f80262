Lockdown has turned most professionals into bakers, cooks and even domestics as people self isolate to stop the spread of COVID-19. Even rugby captain, Siya Kolisi, has taken to cleaning his family home. The Springbok is a marvel to watch on the rugby field, and yesterday proved that he has mad cleaning skills too. Kolisi posted a video on his Instagram page, mopping his house floors, much to the amazement of Mzansi’s women. But he went a step further to challenge all men to do the same. “Starting a challenge for Men! Tag me in your house cleaning or cooking posts and you could win a signed rugby tshirt. Also drop your hashtag options below for this challenge….. masiye,” he captioned his post.   Somaya Stockenstroom
