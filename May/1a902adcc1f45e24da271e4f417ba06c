The number of people infected by COVID-19 will keep increasing as citizens return to work, President Cyril Ramaphosa warned this morning, noting that the global pandemic will be with us for more than a year or even longer. In his weekly message, “From the Desk of the President”, Ramaphosa said health experts around the globe have warned of a second wave of infections, adding that South Africa would not be spared from this reality. The president said the country’s next phase of the response to the virus would involve continuity and change, at the centre of which would be intensive screening, testing and mass sanitisation of workplaces, public transport spaces, among others. “The transition to the next phase of the coronavirus response, that of recovery, will be more difficult than the present one. The risk of infection outbreaks will increase. The demands on our clinics and hospitals and medical personnel will grow,’ he said. Ramaphosa’s sentiments came as the number of people who have tested positive for the novel Coronavirus jumped to over 10 000 yesterday, with deaths related to the pandemic at 194. A total of 341 336 tests have been conducted to date, with recoveries sitting at 4173. The president said the easing of lockdown restrictions should not result in reckless behaviour by individuals and companies keen to resume activity at the cost of human life. “Even after lockdown – especially after lockdown – we will still need to observe social distancing, wear face masks, wash hands regularly, and avoid contact with other people; we will need to re-organise workplaces, schools, universities, colleges and other public places to limit transmission,” he said “We will need to adapt to new ways of worshipping, socialising, exercising and meeting that minimise opportunities for the virus to spread,” he added.
