Telecommunications giant MTN said today that it has experienced a surge in data traffic since the lockdown came into effect. MTN, in a statement to shareholders, said the increase in demand for data and digital services has driven a surge in usage and traffic on its networks. The company said data traffic in South Africa was up 86% year-on-year. MTN’s biggest market Nigeria also saw a jump of 156% year-on-year and Ghana recorded a 181% surge in data traffic. However, the group said the disruption of COVID-19 has seen a decline in voice traffic due to subdued economic activity, which has seen a migration to digital connectivity. MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter warned that the group was bracing itself for a tough trading environment due to COVID-19 as  the current environment is marked by “significant uncertainties.” “The COVID-19 situation is an evolving one and will undoubtedly affect the year ahead. Given the uncertainties associated with the duration and economic impact of the pandemic, it is difficult to reliably quantify the direct and indirect financial effects on the business at this early stage,” Shuter said. “The group will continue to focus on business continuity and efficiency, and we have implemented strict measures to preserve resources and strengthen our resilience”
