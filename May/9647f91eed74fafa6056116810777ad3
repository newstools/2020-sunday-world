The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reiterated that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO in a statement said tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. “WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19,” WHO said. “WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19.  There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.” Some media reports have cited researchers at Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital in Paris – who claim that a study they conducted showed nicotine may be preventing COVID-19 from entering cells. South Africa’s government has drawn both scorn and praise for banning the sale of cigarettes. The country is estimated to have more than eight million adult smokers. The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) is challenging the ban on manufacturing and selling cigarettes in the country.
