 The number of COVID-19 global infections in South Africa continues to spike, with the country recording yet another high number in new cases at 698 today. Health minister Zweli Mkhize has reported that the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape recorded the highest number of new infections of coronavirus at 148 and 484 cases respectively. The total number of those infected by the virus sits at 11 350, with 369 697 tests conducted. On Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa warned in his weekly letter that the number of new cases was expected to surge as people return to work. He also noted that the pandemic was likely to be with the country for over a year or even longer. Addressing nurses on International Nurses Day, Mkhize noted that the country had lost nurses in the battle against COVID-19. “On behalf of my department, I would like to dedicate this day to all our nurses, especially those nurses who have lost their lives to the pandemic. Their contribution to the fight against the pandemic is immeasurable,” he said. Mkhize commended nurses for their efforts in the fight against the spread of the virus. Last week, the minister revealed that 511 health workers had contracted the disease and two – a doctor and a nurse – had died due to the virus. “In appreciation of your service as government we undertake to give you adequate training, ensure sufficient protection and appropriate recognition of your contribution in the service of the nation,”
