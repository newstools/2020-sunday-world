By Philani Mzila Muso unhappy over lack of support Maskandi legend Phuzekhemisi is another musician to dump Universal Music Group (UMG). Real name Zibokwakhe Mnyandu from Umlazi outside Durban, the Udlayedwa muso allegedly refused to extend his stay with UMG as he had allegedly been unhappy at the stable before his murder trial. He is reportedly rejoining Gallo Music. According to insiders at UMG, Phuzekhemisi seems to have been upset with the stable after it allegedly failed to support him through his murder case, which was dropped early this year. “Phuzekhemisi is happy that he left UMG because he felt they were not helping his career reach new heights. The stable was battling to understand his music and his target market. This is the reason why his last album didn’t do well sales wise,” a source from Gallo Music said. Phuzekhemisi confirmed dumping UMG. “They failed to market my previous albums. At some stage, I felt as if they didn’t understand my music and my target market. This is the reason I decided to leave them even though they wanted me to extend my stay with them,” he said, confirming he has rejoined Gallo. “It is worrying that big-name artists are jumping ship. Phuzekhemisi was offered another contract but opted not to renew it because he felt that since he arrived at UMG he never achieved anything major. Phuzekhemisi decided not to renew his contract because the promises that were made to him were never met,” another source, this time from UMG, said. Attempts to get comment from UMG legal representative Michelle Green proved fruitless as her phone rang unanswered and the e-mails that were sent to her a week ago were ignored. Meanwhile, award-winning artist Deborah Fraser told Sunday World that she too “was at the door” at UMG and was not sure when she would close it. SUNDAY WORLD
