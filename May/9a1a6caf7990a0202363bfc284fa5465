Cape Town DJ, Max Hurrel, is a wanted man. This after remixing the controversial tobacco speech by Doctor Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. The minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs tweeted on Wednesday: “Who is this Max Hurrell fellow? We just need to talk. Various parodies have been made to the beat, ridiculing the Minister’s speech – where she explained why government was keeping the ban on tobacco in place. Just a few days earlier President Cyril Ramaphosa had lifted the cigarette ban. Justifying why they decided against selling cigarettes, she said: “When people zol, they put saliva on the paper, and then they share that zol.” This was to demonstrate the dangers of spreading COVID-19 among smokers who roll their own stash. It’s also been reported that the catchy track is now in the top 50 of the streaming chart on Apple Music. Dlamini-Zuma didn’t explain if she was annoyed, insulted or pleasantly surprised. The DJ, who previously explained he wanted to provide some comic relief during the lockdown, replied to the Minister jovially.  “Hi there Minister, Please follow me so I can DM you My details!” On His Instagram page, he admitted: “It just got real.” Watch video here
