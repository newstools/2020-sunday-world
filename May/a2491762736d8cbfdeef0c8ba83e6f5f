The Council for Medical Schemes (CMS) said today, its chairperson Clarence Mini has died due to complications related to the deadly COVID-19. The Council in a statement said Mini had been hospitalised for more than a month after he tested positive for the novel virus which has already claimed more than 200 lives in the country. The Council’s spokesperson Grace Khoza said Mini’s death is a sad day for the CMS and the medical schemes industry as a whole. “This wonderful, compassionate and likeable individual leaves a legacy of having served this country and industry in many capacities with great distinction,” said Khoza. “Dr Mini leaves behind his beloved children Yandi and Nomhle, but above all his soul mate and best friend Mrs Nancy Mini. He shall be sorely missed by his family, colleagues and all industry stakeholders.” Mini, who is a medical doctor, was appointed to head the regulator which oversees the R160 billion medical schemes industry by erstwhile Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. His three-year tenure was due to end in five months.
