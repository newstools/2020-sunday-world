Reality star and businesswoman, Mome Mahlangu, said her mission during this pandemic, is to help struggling girls who can’t afford sanitary towels because menstruation doesn’t go into lockdown. “Menstruation does not have a lockdown period. With the situation and economy looking dire as each day passes and following the presidential announcement of compulsory wearing of masks in public, I have offered to donate a number of masks and sanitary pads through my foundation, MsMomeWellnessFoundation,” she said. “I’m very passionate about girls and women in general. I have always wanted to reach a point of being able to do something and be consistent in it. I can’t reach girls in Cape Town due to lockdown but I have sent a bulk of pads to one of our distributors, Infuse Bar Wellness in the Cape and they will give the essentials to the girls in Cape Town,” she said. Speaking to Sunday World, Mahlangu who is the wife to comedian Mongezi ‘Toll Ass Mo’, said her charity work has been an ongoing practice but the COVID-19 pandemic has compelled her to do a little more than what she would normally do. “I just don’t make it public knowledge but this pandemic has changed the world economy drastically, the locals are crying for help, they don’t have funds especially right now. I had to find a way to contribute these essentials to girls in the township. I can only imagine the girl who can’t afford to buy pads right now cause parents are not receiving monthly and weekly wages,” said Mahlangu. Among other townships, she has donated her time to areas of Soweto, Alexandra, and Tembisa. “We don’t know when things will get back to normal, sanitizers and sanitary pads are now an expensive essential product that my company MrsMomeWellness will continue to contribute to the disadvantaged,” she said.
