Tributes are pouring in for KwaZulu-Natal deputy speaker Mluleki Ndobe, who allegedly
committed suicide at his home in Durban on Friday. SA Local Government Association said Ndobe, the former mayor of Harry Gwala district municipality, will be remembered for his contribution to the local government sector.
Ndobe is a former Salga KwaZulu-Natal chairperson. Ndobe, along with four other men, was arrested in March last year for the murder of former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa.
However, the charges were withdrawn just over a week later. Magaqa died in a hail of bullets when he and other ANC councillors were sprayed with bullets at a spaza shop in Mzimkhulu, south of Durban in July 2017. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said: “His passing has indeed robbed the ANC of a dedicated leader.” George Matlala
