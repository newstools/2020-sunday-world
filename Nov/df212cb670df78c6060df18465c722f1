Johannesburg – A technical task team comprising of national government departments and the Free State Office of the Premier has been set up to resolve the impasse between the Maluti-a-Phofung local municipality and Eskom. The task team was set up on Friday following a meeting convened by Deputy President David Mabuza to tackle service delivery issues at the municipality with a particular focus on its debt to power utility, Eskom. This rising debt, has led to disruption of electricity supply and provision of other basic services, including water provision. The disruption of services had led to recurring protests by residents over a period of time. The meeting follows commitments made by the Deputy President during the oral replies to the National Council of Provinces on 4 November 2020 and subsequently to the National Assembly on Thursday, 26 November 2020.
