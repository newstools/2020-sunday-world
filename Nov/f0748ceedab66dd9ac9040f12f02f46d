A 31-year-old  Shoshanguve man was sentenced to two life terms and 333 years imprisonment by the Pretoria High Court on Monday, November 16 . This was announced by NPA Regional Spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana. Mahanjana said Kgaugelo Boikanyo Molefi was convicted of 29 counts of crimes ranging from murder, attempted murder, rape, robbery with aggravating circumstances, unlawful possession of firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, pointing of firearm and house breaking with intent to commit robbery. Molefi committed all these crimes in and around Shoshanguve from 2014 to 2018.  In 2014 after committing his first offence, he was arrested but escaped from custody. He was later arrested in 2019 after the Provincial Organised Crime Unit traced him from his hiding place in Kwa-Sokhulumi in Bronkhorstspruit. Sentencing him, Judge Bam said the crimes committed by Molefi were overwhelming as he and his gang terrorised the community of Soshanguve. Bam said Molefi  attacked people on the streets even in the safety of their homes.  He added that Molefe did not care even if he was known to the families of the victims. He said he did not hesitate to commit crimes on people he was friendly with.  Bam also said that he found  Molefi’s conduct inexplicable and said it clearly showed his character. He added that Molefi aim was to instil fear in his victims and was successful in this regard as most witnesses were scared to testify. Therefore, he added, there was no reason for the court to deviate from the minimum sentence. He said what was abundantly clear was for the accused to be permanently removed from the society. Prosecutor, Advocate Esther Kabini, said she was grateful for the co-operation of the law enforcement agencies and the people of Soshanguve who, amongst other things, assisted to bring this matter to finality. She urged communities to be vigilant and report any criminal activities so that they can live in a peaceful and crime free society. Ngwako Malatji
