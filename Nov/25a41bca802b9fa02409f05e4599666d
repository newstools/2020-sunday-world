Johannesburg -Football legend, Diego Maradona, passed away today at the age of 60. It is believed that the former Argentinian midfielder passed away at his Buenos Aires home. He had successful surgery on a brain blood clot earlier in November and was to be treated for alcohol dependency. Maradona was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ‘Hand of God’ goal against England in the quarter-finals. The Argentine Football Association expressed “its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend”, adding: “You will always be in our hearts.” Declaring three days of national mourning, Alberto Fernandez, the president of Argentina, said: “You took us to the top of the world. You made us immensely happy. You were the greatest of them all. Thank you for having existed, Diego. We’re going to miss you all our lives.” Take a look at some of the tributes posted on Twitter for the football legend:     https://twitter.com/afa/status/1331638153149558786/photo/1  Sunday World Ashley Lechman
