 The Jerusalema song which saw the world dance in harmony, has now scored Master KG an MTV EMA award as the Best African Act 2020. In the running for the international award were fellow artists DJ Maphorisa, Kabza de Small and other African artists. Unable to obtain his excitement, his acceptance speech was posted on the MTV Afica Twitter platform, where he thanked all his fans who helped make the song a global hit. Monde Twala, senior vice-president and general manager of ViacomCBS Networks Africa said the song has bought together across cultures and congratulated him on this massive win. “Master KG’s accolade at this year’s MTV EMA is testament to his global popularity that has seen people all over the world unite in dance to his smash hit, Jerusalema, during one of the most unprecedented times in our history. MTV continues to celebrate all the nominees in the best African act category and are proud to elevate local talent across our platforms as we take African pop culture and music to the world,” said Twala. The awards were pre-recorded from various locations across the globe as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and aired last night on MTV and MTV Base. South Africans can view the repeat show tonight.
