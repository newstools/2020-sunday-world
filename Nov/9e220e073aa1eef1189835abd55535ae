Johannesburg – Absa bank is accusing Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club boss Lawrence Mulaudzi of failing to play ball and is demanding two Bentleys, a R9-million home loan and more than R300 000 in overdraft funds from the football club boss . Sunday World can exclusively reveal that Absa has obtained three combined summons in the Joburg High Court and is seeking orders to repossess Mulaudzi’s R 6.5-million property in Sandhurst in Joburg, two Bentley vehicles valued at more than R5.9 million and a Mercedez-Benz worth more than R1.3-million. It is also seeking judgment against Mulaudzi, who is already collapsing under a mountain of debt, for failing to pay at least R300 000 of an overdraft he obtained a year ago. The bank’s lawyers, Tim du Toit & Company Inc, said Mulaudzi and Black Gold Family Trust, whose trustees are him, Tshifumulo Mulaudzi and Thilivhali Prince Mulaudzi, obtained a loan of R9-million on September 27 last year to purchase an incomplete property in the exclusive suburb of Sandhurst. Mulaudzi was required to pay more than R95 000 in monthly instalments for 240 months from December 1 last year. But the Venda-born tycoon apparently defaulted on the loan and was more than R635 000 in arrears, prompting the bank to apply for an order to attach and sell the property. The city of Joburg is said to be owed R140 000 in rates and taxes. The bank also said on April 15 last year, it advanced a R2.5-million loan to Mulaudzi to buy a R3-million Bentley Continental GTV8 2017 model afterer putting down a deposit.
