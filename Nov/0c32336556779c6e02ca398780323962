The ANC Free State members who marched on the party’s headquarters demanding the resignation of secretary general Ace Magashule have been left with egg on their face. This after they wrote a letter to Magashule and affidavits apologising about the march last month. The members said Magashule, the former Free State premier and long serving provincial chairperson, should step aside for his alleged involvement in the Vrede diary project and the asbestos saga. But the group has since apologised, saying that they were misled by other people. “Mr Magashule and Mr Mpho Chakane, and also the MEC Mahasa, we are kneeling and asking for forgiveness for the thing [marching to Luthuli House in Johannesburg] we have done,” Mokone Moeketsi said in an affidavit. “Our boss, we wanted to meet you with work related issues. We found ourselves in the wrong. We were with wrong people.” The group had been singing that Magashule “ke lemenemene, makahambe [he is a liar, he should go].” George Matlala
