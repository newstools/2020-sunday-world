Nel said that police have uncovered new evidence on the mastermind behind the killing of the former South African soccer star. The case was postponed to 5 March 2021. Afriforum’s Kallie kriel, tweeted, “Afriforum and #GerrieNel believes that there is now an even a stronger case against the mastermind. We will apply pressure to ensure that next time we also see the mastermind in the dock.” Scelo Ntuli, the uncle of one of the accused, Sifiso Ntuli, told Jacaranda News, outside court earlier today that that the families of the accused believe that Senzo Meyiwa’s killers are being protected. The five suspects, Bongani Ntanzi, Mthobisi Mncube, Mthokosizi Maphisa, Sifisokuhle Ntuli and Muzikawulahlelwa Sibiya, are charged with allegedly murdering Meyiwa at his girlfriend’s family home in Vosloorus. Previously at the first appearance of the five accused, they refused to enter the courtroom as they claimed that they were being framed for the soccer star’s murder. According to NPA spokesperson, Sipho Ngwema, the state believes that they are confident that the people arrested are strongly linked to the crime. The accused maintained their innocence and said they were not involved in the crime. Take a look at how Twitter reacted to the court appearance below:         Sunday World Ashley Lechman
