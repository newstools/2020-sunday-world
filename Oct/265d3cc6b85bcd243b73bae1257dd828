On September 27 we published a story claiming that popular comedian Tshepo Mogale of Siyaswima fame had defaulted on his bond repayments. The story further said that Mogale has persistently failed to adhere to demands for payments and is facing a court order for his house to be attached and sold by the bank.
Our information was completely wrong.
The bond defaulter was another Tshepo Mogale and not the comedian. We apologise unreservedly to Mogale for the error and the embarrassment he has suffered.
All copies of the story have been removed from our electronic platforms and steps are being taken to have it removed from other platforms where it was posted. SUNDAY WORLD
