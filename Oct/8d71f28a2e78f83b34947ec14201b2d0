The state is ready to proceed with the trial of EFF President Julius Malema  and the party’s MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi  when they appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court tomorrow for assault. This was announced by NPA South Gauteng Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane on Monday. The pair are accused of assaulting  a police officer at the funeral of ANC veteran Winnie Madikizela Mandela in April 2018. The two have denied assaulting the cop, despite allegations that they were caught on CCTV doing so. They said all they wanted was to  enter the cemetery and bury Madikizela-Mandela but the cop  tried to prevent them from doing so. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)  had initially declined to  prosecute the duo but later reconsidered after continued pressure from AfriForum. The lobby group  wanted to pursue private prosecution  against the two  after it alleged the NPA  had dragged its feet on the case. Ngwako Malatji
