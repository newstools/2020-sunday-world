With Usain Bolt running like the flash, it’s no surprise that he named his newborn daughter Lightning. Her full name is Olympia Lightning Bolt. A name the Olympic star earned after setting a world record of 9.58 seconds in the 100-metre race at the World Championships in Berlin, 2009. This earned him the reputation of being the fastest man in history. <img class="size-medium wp-image-9819 aligncenter" src="https://834721.smushcdn.com/1688953/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Usain-Boltbaby-300x300.jpg?lossy=0&strip=1&webp=1" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://834721.smushcdn.com/1688953/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Usain-Boltbaby-150x150.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 150w, https://834721.smushcdn.com/1688953/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Usain-Boltbaby-300x300.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 300w, https://834721.smushcdn.com/1688953/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Usain-Boltbaby-422x420.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 422w, https://834721.smushcdn.com/1688953/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Usain-Boltbaby.jpg?lossy=0&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 615w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> The sports star revealed his daughter’s name in a dedication post to his girlfriend, Kasi Bennett, on Instagram today, wishing her a happy 21st birthday.
