Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane, now the leader of the One SA Movement, is calling for a national stay-away from schools on Friday. He, however, says that he is not calling on people to gather in the streets and have a loud protest but rather a silent protest marked by staying home. “We are simply saying because we can’t gather, let’s stay away. [To] send a message to government that we are unhappy with their decision. Show the department [of basic education] that the power still remains with the people,” he said. To date, 2 470 teachers have been infected with the coronavirus while another 1 260 have tested positive for COVID-19. Maimane had previously attempted to have the decision of schools opening reversed by the high court in Pretoria. But his application was dismissed.    Somaya Stockenstroom
