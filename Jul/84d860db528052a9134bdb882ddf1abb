The daughter of former Rabali Blackpool chairman Peter Rabali, Takalani, has confirmed that her father passed away early this morning at the Mulbarton Hospital in Johannesburg following after a short illness. Takalani did not want to elaborate as she was still distraught to talk. Rabali, 73, formed the club after purchasing the franchise of D’Alberton Callies during the 1994/95 season. He relocated the club to Thohoyandou and renamed it Rabali Blackpool. As football club owner and businessman, he held majority shares at Dynamos from 1995 but sold the club to businessman Pat Malabela. The other 45% belonged to a group of eight individuals led by current Safa Vhembe secretary Eric Muneri before Malabela bought out all of them. In one of the most controversial episodes of Rabali’s stint as a soccer official, he was banned for life from football in 1999 after he was busted offering officials from a National First Division club City Sharks a bribe to sway the results of the game in favour of his outfit Dynamos. Rabali’s Dynamos was short of three points to gain promotion to the elite Premiership at the time of the incident. Xolile Mtshazo
