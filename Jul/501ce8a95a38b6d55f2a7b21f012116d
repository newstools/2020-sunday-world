Tributes from many South African artists have poured in for the trendsetter, Vusi “Papers 707” Mabuza, who made some signature Amapiano dance moves a vibe. It has been reported that his death was caused by gout, at the age of 42. The tragic news of his death came just a week after he buried his mother. Papers, who released a mixtape with Thaba DA DJ, titled Lockdown medication vol 2, last month, first became popular because of his unique dance moves. These classic steps were often copied by Cassper Nyovest, DJ Lamiez Holworthy and others.          Somaya Stockenstroom
