The two best friends have been rumoured to be dating numerous times, but Mnisi is a member of the LGBTQI community. Thulo has kept fans on their toes as she is very private about her love life, which leads to fans assuming and guessing who she is, if even, romantically involved with. One of the rumoured lovers is said to be Maps Maponyane. The rumours gained traction after Thulo gifted Maponyane’s mother with her recently launched perfume. Maponyane posted a video to his social media of his mother singing praises for Thulo, to which Thulo replied, “Tell Mama I love her too! Very much! I hope she enjoys the goodies.” Earlier last month, Thulo also wished digital innovater, Sivuyile Madikana a happy birthday as well.
