Johannesburg – Married musician Phelo Bala tells us how he stays so good-looking amid Covivi. Bala is one South Africa’s most dashing celebrities, and we asked him how he looks after himself for the festive season. “My hair grows very fast so I like to visit the barber at least once a week, for my skin-care routine. I’ve three different face washes depending on season. “Although I’m not a dapper dresser, I prefer my style simple and comfortable and could never go on a trip without my jeans. I also love my sunscreen as it’s a great moisturiser and protector for my skin.”     Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
