Johannesburg – A conflict of duty happens when a person is required to fulfil two or more roles that may be in conflict with each other. It can be an actual, potential or a perceived conflict of duty. For example, a director may also hold a position as a public servant, or they may be a member of the board of another public entity or body. A conflict of duty may also arise through a director having official duties in respect of other government bodies, community and professional associations or non-governmental organisations. An example would be an NLC employee who is a lay preacher and his/her church applies for NLC funding and s/he does not declare that they are the leader of the church. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16501" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE.png" alt="" width="990" height="796" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE.png 990w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE-300x241.png 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE-768x618.png 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE-696x560.png 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict-ONE-522x420.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /> The four categories of conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty that we could encounter at the NLC are: A Potential Conflict Exists When an NLC Employee Has Interests Which Are Not Relevant, but It Is Reasonably Foreseeable That in the Future, Personal Interests Could Become Relevant Interests. 2. Perceived conflicts of interest or conflicts A perceived conflict of interest is one in which a reasonable person would think that the official’s judgment is likely to be 3. Actual conflicts of interest or conflicts of This is the situation where an NLC employee has existing private interests that are relevant (which will interfere with objectivity). 4. Actual conflicts of interest or conflicts of The intensity of the conflict of interest is of such an extent that it cannot be managed and must be disposed of or ceased. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16502" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Confict2.png" alt="" width="580" height="553" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Confict2.png 580w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Confict2-300x286.png 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Confict2-441x420.png 441w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16503" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-1024x571.png" alt="" width="696" height="388" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-1024x571.png 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-300x167.png 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-768x428.png 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-696x388.png 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-1068x596.png 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3-753x420.png 753w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Conflict3.png 1219w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> A perceived conflict of interest is one in which a reasonable person would think that the official’s judgment is likely to be compromised. Actual conflicts of interest This Is the Situation Where an NLC Employee Has Existing Private Interests That Are Relevant (Will Interfere With his/her Objectivity). The Intensity of the Conflict of Interest Is of Such an Extent That It Cannot Be Managed and Must Be Disposed of or Ceased. An Example Would Be an Employee or a Spouse or Child of an Employee or Executive of the NLC Being a Director of a Company That Has Received a Tender in the Organisation. Alternatively, a Child of an Employee Being Offered Employment in a Department Where Their Parent Works Is an Actual Conflict of Interest, Circumstance or Duty. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16506" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-1024x525.png" alt="" width="696" height="357" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-1024x525.png 1024w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-300x154.png 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-768x394.png 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-696x357.png 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-1068x548.png 1068w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY-819x420.png 819w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ConflictWHY.png 1121w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> What the NLC says about dealing with conflicts of interests? What are our obligations in terms of the NLC conflict of interest framework? What type of recommendations are made in the assessment report? <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16508" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/three.png" alt="" width="562" height="750" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/three.png 562w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/three-225x300.png 225w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/three-315x420.png 315w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /> A comprehensive assessment report is subsequently issued for employees where the expectation is for employees to rebut or remedy the result of the assessment. The recommendation within the report guides the Employee, Divisional Head and the Commissioner on how to manage the conflict of interest or circumstance or duty pertaining to the employee. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16509" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer.png" alt="" width="869" height="528" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer.png 869w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer-300x182.png 300w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer-768x467.png 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer-696x423.png 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/teer-691x420.png 691w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /> IMG_0353 Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
