UNIONS We adore love, loyalty and good-looking couples, so we had a fantastic year rooting for the old and excited couples. Love seeing Siya Kolisi and his Rachel. Not sure why, just had space.

Proud of you.   Popular entertainer Somizi is still tongue lashing with hubby despite rumours of disinterest.   Lerato Kganyago decided during Covid to announce her divorce to a Thami Ndala – occupation unknown.   This was bizarre as the wedding announcement had never been as controversial as a statement on Instagram. A few days later, they were back together in their mansion, which we think they own. Fikile Mbalula and Somizi have an interesting friendship which saw Somizi leaking lockdown information, apologizing and paying a fine. All during lockdown while we were isolating minister Stella was also in the hot seat after being seen at a dinner and posing against a lavish car while locals starved. She came up with reasons and was put on leave. Another perpetually interesting union was Somizi and other people’s ideas. We wonder if it will be a norm next year – being accused of stealing ideas like Daniel Marvin steals tweets Boity debut project titled 4436 is being streamed like a reflex action, her fragrance and body care line are popular and the triple threat is getting paid, but alas, there are those who continue to remind her that she called them roaches. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17310" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-807x1024.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="883" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-807x1024.jpg 807w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-236x300.jpg 236w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-768x974.jpg 768w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-696x883.jpg 696w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1-331x420.jpg 331w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P18-Boity-Thulo-1.jpg 886w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> Serial husband Lebo M is all about rekindling his life with his third wife Angela, who claimed years ago that she had heard she had been divorced via the newspapers, When Lebo M replaced her. We are happy for you, Mr Lion King, and may you keep producing hits.

Rami Chuene is flourishing after her dramatic exit from The Queen, and it goes to show that there are many doors.   Hot mgosi celebs The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of 2020, barring Covid Births, unions and other such affairs Cassper Nyovest and baby Kgotso Phelo Bala and Moshe got married and people decided to mind their business as there were claims of violence, cheating, candlestick bashing and stitches weeks before. Oh and an album. Lebo Keswa and Letoya’s whirlwind romance is said to be going strong.   Loved Busiswa and Moonchild Sanelly being featured on Beyonce’s Lion King-inspired album.   Anatii and DJ Lag, you guys made us proud, like Trevor Noah hosting the Grammy’s. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2044" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="591" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii.jpg 472w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-240x300-1.jpg 240w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-335x420-1.jpg 335w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-230x288-1.jpg 230w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-350x438-1.jpg 350w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-26x32.png 26w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-29x36.png 29w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P10Anatii-38x48-1.jpg 38w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /> Follow @SundayWorldZA on Twitter and @sundayworldza on Instagram, or like our Facebook Page, Sunday World, by clicking here for the latest breaking news in South Africa.
