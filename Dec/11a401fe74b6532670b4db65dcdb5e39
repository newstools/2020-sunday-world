Johannesburg – A 45-year-old brigadier, Rosey Resondt, working for SAPS National Organised Crime today appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates’ Court with her husband, Clifford Cornelius Resondt, who is the head of security for Shepherd Bushiri. They appeared on charges of corruption. This is after Clifford Resondt was arrested on 20 January 2018 for allegedly raping his wife’s niece. An amount of R500 000 was transferred from the Shepherd Bushiri Ministries to Rosey’s account on 22 January 2018 and the money was paid over to the home loan account of the victim’s parents. On the same day, when the money reflected on the parents’ account, the child dropped the rape charges against Resondt. At the next court date the matter was withdrawn.
