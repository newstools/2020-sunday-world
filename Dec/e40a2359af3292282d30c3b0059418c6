As of today, the total number of confirmed  Covid-19 cases is 828 598, the total number of deaths is 22 574 and the total number of recoveries is 754 658.  Watch as the minister urges the public to follow safety protocols:  According to the department of Health, four provinces have been identified as key drivers to the second wave. “It is also important to highlight that four provinces, that being, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Gauteng Province are the key drivers of this new wave,” the department said. According to the department of health, the majority of new Covid-19 cases today are from WC (30%) followed by EC (24%) then KZN which accounted for 23%; and GP accounted for 17%. Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West each accounted for 1% of new cases respectively while Northern Cape accounted for less than 1%. “In the last 2 days the age distribution of new cases showed a different pattern from the norm: peak age in this period is in the 15-19 age group.
