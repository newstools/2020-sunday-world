Johannesburg – Actress Buhle Samuels’ depature from Muvhango is shrouded in mystery, with two versions that she resigned while another suggests she was fired from the SABC2 soapie. Sources said the bootylicious actress was given the boot because of her erratic on-set behaviour, which had become too much to handle for the producers. This was revealed by two members of the production team and an actor who are privy to the TV star’s dramatic exit. One crew member said Samuels, who plays Matshidiso Mofokeng in the soapie, was a nightmare to work with and too demanding.

Another production staffer said Samuels had crazy demands, a bad attitude and was rude to make-up artists and other support staff. “She is a great actress, but her behaviour is unspeakable. She has a short temper and unpredictable outbursts. She was literally fighting with everyone on set,” a crew member.
