Johannesburg – The affluent suburb of Hyde Park streets are filled with Jozi’s rich and famous, so it is only fitting that the local mall glows up for the festive season. If music be the food of love, then play on! To reflect a Festive tone, that is exactly what Beyond Africa will be doing on 12 December at Hyde Park Corner. Relax into your Festive shopping experience with a live performance by this talented classical duo featuring Jude on the harp and Kabelo on the violin. The mall has also taken the hassle out of wrapping your purchases for you with Gift Wrapping Stations which are free to shoppers, all they ask is that you make a donation to Rays of Hope. Got that one person who is impossible to buy for? A Hyde Park Corner Gift Card solves that dilemma – give the gift of choice this Christmas (available from our Concierge Desk). And if you need some creative inspiration, don’t miss the Shabalala Designs exhibition featuring the latest ceramic artwork by Alex Shabalala and other local artists at the Hyde Park Corner Banking Court until 23 December.
