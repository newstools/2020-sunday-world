Johannesburg – South African Rapper and TV Personality Boity Thulo is releasing her long awaited EP titled 4436 on Friday. The album follows a series of smash hits since making her rap debut two years ago with the Wuz Dat track featuring Nasty C. Representing the North West, Boity, who is also signed to acclaimed Def Jam Africa star, says she named the EP after her grandmother’s house in Potchefstroom, where she was raised. It features a host of multi-talented stars such as Riky Rick, Yanga Chief, Maggz, Ginger Trill and Maglera Doe Boy.

I want to thank my fans for their patience, my producers for the same patience and the work they put in. I honestly can’t wait for the fans to hear this! We worked,” she said.
