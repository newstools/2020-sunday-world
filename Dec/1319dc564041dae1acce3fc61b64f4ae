Johannesburg – Moegoe of the week: Ricardo Mettler is a moegoe after he was found guilty of stealing an R8-million painting by Jacobus Hendrik Pierneef in a government building in Bloemfontein. The moegoe, who is ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule’s former driver and bodyguard, has been found guilty of theft, fraud, money-laundering and perjury. The disappearance of the painting from the Free State government’s headquarters was the subject of a criminal investigation after Mettler tried to sell it to a local businessman. The businessman went to have the piece evaluated at Gauteng-based Strauss and Co, unknowingly causing alarm. Strauss and Co alerted the authorities.
