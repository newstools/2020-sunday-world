Global view According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), global cases remained high at approximately four million new infections, even though a slight downward trend was observed. However, according to the WHO’s COVID-19 weekly epidemiological update, deaths continue to rise, with over 69 000 new fatalities reported worldwide. America remained the major contributor for new weekly cases last week. “Although the European region reported a continued decrease in new weekly cases, it still accounts for the second greatest proportion of new weekly cases, while death rates have continued to increase and accounted for approximately half of the new global deaths in the past week,” the agency explained. The Eastern Mediterranean region registered a slight decline in both cases and deaths last week, after four months of continued increases. Also, a small increase was reported in the African and South-East Asia regions, and more substantively from the Western Pacific region last week. In the past week, the United States reported the highest number of new cases of over 1.1 million cases (0.3% increase from the previous week), India (over 297 000 cases, 6% increase), Brazil (over 218 000 new cases, 4% increase), Italy (over 184 000 new cases, 22% decrease) and Russian Federation (over 179 000 new cases, 10% increase). Africa According to WHO, Africa reported about 48 000 new cases and just under 1 000 new deaths last week. The highest number of new cases and deaths was reported from South Africa (19 730 new cases, 333 new cases per 1 million), Algeria (7438 new cases, 170 new cases per 1 million), Kenya (6201 new cases, 115 new cases per 1 million), Ethiopia (3578 new cases, 31 new cases per 1 million), and Uganda (2277 new cases, 50 new cases per 1 million). WHO said in the past three weeks, cases in South Africa increased by over 20% week-on-week, with 19 730 new cases reported last week (3 500 more than the previous week). “The rise in new cases in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape are a cause for concern,” the agency said. Meanwhile, as of 30 November, Gauteng, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces have reported 79% of the total cumulative cases. As of 1 December, there are 62 844 837 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1 465 144 deaths globally. Sunday World SUNDAY WORLD
