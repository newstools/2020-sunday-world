It is not true that President Cyril Ramaphosa is going to announce a new ban on the sale of alcohol tonight. This was confirmed by Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu in a tweet. An unverified voice note that has been circulating for much of the day today claimed that Ramaphosa would again ban the sale of alcohol. This has caused a panic that led to thousands of South Africans flocking to liquor outlets to stockpile. But it has been confirmed that this is fake news. “It’s not true that President @CyrilRamaphosa will address the nation tonight. It is equally not true that the NCCC/Cabinet has taken a decision to disallow the sale of alcohol, a tweet from Mthembu reads. “This is all #fakenews,” he added. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-11617 aligncenter" src="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/booze.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/booze.jpg 225w, https://sundayworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/booze-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />
