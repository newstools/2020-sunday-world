 The now retired Harpur was on the books of Dundee and Kilmarnock in the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons, respectively. The 37-year-old Johannesburg-born shot-stopper was a perennial benchwarmer in Scotland, playing only one league game for Kilmarnock and one for Dundee in the second-tier. Harpur retired in 2010 after leaving local club Black Aces a year earlier. He also had spells at Ajax Cape Town, Maritzburg United and Leeds United in England. At the moment, Holden is playing for Consett AFC in English Northern League Division 1. The defender, who was born in Krugersdorp, played for Rose Country, whom he helped win the Scottish League Cup in the 2015/16 campaign, where he played two games and scored a goal. However, Holden disappointingly never featured in a league match that particular season. The 26-year-od Holden also had spells at English League 2 side Hartlepool United. Kyle, 29, is still plying his trade in Scotland with championship outfit Greennork Morton FC. The Johannesburg-born holding midfielder came through Livingston’s youth ranks. Livingston promoted Kyle in 2009 before he joined Kilmarnock in 2013. Kyle is arguably the most successful SA player to have campaigned in Scotland, with 346 championship matches under his belt, plus five in the Premiership. Thirty-year-old Keaghan is Kyle’s older brother playing for Livingston in the Scottish Premier League. This season, Keaghan has already amassed 24 league games games without a goal, but with an assist. Many SA fans would remember Keaghan for his stint at Bidvest Wits in the 2015/16 term, featuring in just one Absa Premiership encounter. Over the years, Keaghan has racked up over 50 appearances in the Scottish top flight.
