Unwanted at pregnancy, cursed at development Abandoned at birth, adopted at one Loved from then, molested at five Silenced with sweets, chocolate and fudge Abused each day, raped each night He called it love, that’s why he took me in It went on until 12, I told at 13 They said that I lied, and I was told to zip it My mother she just cried, To her husband I was none I regret ever telling, Mama says take one for the team mtanam I got hated in higher grade, and turned out at 14 The streets became my home, Loneliness became my friend A drug addict at 15, A prostitute at 16 Sweet, sweet 16 An alcoholic to add to that, and arrested for stealing Beaten in jail, exposed to the unthinkable I feel no more pain, it has grown in my blood Released in two months, back in two weeks Pregnant at 18, the father not known Loved by none, hated by all Enslaved by society, judged, banished, buried by life A child in this world, would pay for my sins As they always say, like mother, like child So I stand here today, on my highest low point Ready to embrace my long-awaited departure Hopefully the after world, Has enough love for two! Hopefully the after world, Has enough love for two!! Silent Night Shhhhhhh Alone at night, she painfully stares as the clock strikes ten Her stomach churns and twists knots of agony and mayhem A shadow emerges as the door slowly opens Out of sight he whispers, “Daddy’s home, Daddy’s home, little angel” As others rush to dreamland, her nightmare slowly begins She sits in a corner, quiet as a mouse Curled up like a tennis ball ready to be bounced to safety While rough hands scratch and pull her to stand Her face turned, her eyes closed, she avoids his unfeeling stare Her face turned, her eyes closed, she avoids his mocking, stained smile His soul so cold, the devil is no match She pulls, she cries, she fights, she screams… She fails He slaps so hard she goes reeling across the floor like a wind-driven piece of paper On the cold, hard, uninviting floor he spreads her, he undresses her tiny defenceless body Like a painful, icy storm in winter he plunders through her already torn being With every strike, with every blow, she slowly gives up the fight For she already knows, it is a losing battle Her cries become tearless as she strongly takes in the pain For even though she’s been through hell, she still won’t be broken With a heavy heart she looks at her mama’s picture towering on the wall With a broken soul she silently asks why? “Why did you escape this mother of hell and leave me behind?Why did you take your innocent life but spared mine?” As he sighs in satisfied relief for a job well done The last flicker of light fades, then goes out completely Swallowing the very last flicker of hope!
