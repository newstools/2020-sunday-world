By Theo Nyhaba Gomora actor Peter Mashigo has been accused by his estranged wife of being a deadbeat dad. The actor, who was featured on numerous soapies and telenovelas, including The Throne and Isibaya, has allegedly failed to pay papgeld for 11 years and is now in arrears of R390 000, according to court documents. The veteran actor was expected to fork out R3 000 a month towards the maintenance of his two children, a 15-year-old and 24-year-old. His wife alleges he last paid maintenance in 2009. She alleges that the actor was not only refusing to fulfill his fatherly responsibilities, but was also fighting her over the use of a piece of land they acquired before separating. This is despite an agreement they had signed allowing her to build a home for the kids. She said their dream collapsed because of the actor’s philandering ways, which led to the end of their 20 -year marriage. She alleges further that Mashigo had promised to give the land to his girlfriend, who is almost the same age as his daughter, charging that she had to halt construction after Mashigo made a U-turn on his commitment. This, she said, happened after the actor had rocked up at the property and ordered construction workers to down tools, telling them that they did not have his approval to build on the site. “I had to stop paying the construction workers because I had already bought the material. I am now paying for storage on top of paying rent and school fees on my own,” she explained. Mashigo did not wish to comment on the matter.
