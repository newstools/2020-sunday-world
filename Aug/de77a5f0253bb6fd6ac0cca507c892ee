Nombuso Msweli, a third-year information technology student at the Durban University of Technology (DUT), has been selected as the ambassador for Google’s Women Techmakers (WTM) programme. Msweli, a software developer from Mtubatuba in northern KwaZulu-Natal, has joined a team of women leaders from around the world who were selected by Google to excel in technology. She said she has been praying for this opportunity. “A lot of women apply to be WTMs and it makes me really happy to be one of the selected to represent Google Developer Groups (GDG) Cloud Durban and my university,” said Msweli. “I will now accomplish one of my biggest goals and that is to work with women and host events to inspire and uplift females in my field of study.” Women Techmakers is a global programme that celebrates women, encouraging them to pursue and excel in technology careers. “I have been working with Fanie Ndlovu at Varsity Genie since 2018. Fanie, being a GDG Cloud Durban organiser, appointed me as one of the organisers responsible for leading women-based events in the GDG Cloud Durban. “GDG Cloud Durban wanted a woman organiser to represent them as a WTM, which required me to go through the selection process. The selection is based on your involvement in projects that promote gender equality in the tech spaces,” she added. Her goal is to set up innovation youth centres to bring technology to rural areas that will teach people new skills. She also plans to work with women-based organisations to steer women in leadership and entrepreneurship.
