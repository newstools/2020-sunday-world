Nomuzie Moozlie Mabena has joined the likes of AKA and partnered with CRUZ Vodka as their latest brand partner. Coinciding with the Spring season Moozlie has officially joined, as the alcohol brand launches its new offering, CRUZ Manhattan Blossom. “This relationship has been years in the making with Moozlie as a loyal friend of CRUZ, becoming a staple on the brand’s exclusive, star-studded SA Fashion Week party guest list,” said CRUZ Vodka’s Brand Manager, Kayla Hendricks. The 28-year-old started out as a model in Benoni, and shot up the ranks and hearts of South Africans when she won the MTV Base VJ search in 2012. She has cemented her presence as a rapper, fashion designer, model, creative, mogul – not only within SA Hip-Hop, but other industries too. “This is like a full-circle moment for me. A seed planted over many years has finally blossomed. CRUZ Vodka is one of the most forward-thinking brands I’ve ever worked with. From what the team have been able to achieve with AKA to all the exciting things we’ve got planned with Manhattan Blossom, I appreciate that this brand respects the influence & creative genius artists bring to the table I have no doubt this will lead to more music, more good times, more milestones and more success for the whole team,” said Moozlie. Hendricks said the terms of the agreement are set for a long-term business relationship, set to earn her share in the vodka’s profit split per bottle sold throughout Africa – a rare deal in the South African spirit beverage industry. “We’re honoured to have Moozlie leading the way both for our brand and for those who will follow the agenda. Celebrating a time of transition from one of the worst Winters we’ve seen – that has little to do with the weather – we look forward to a Spring that poses ample opportunity for positive momentum. May this partnership lead the way for a new season, a new rule, and a new partnership set to Blossom,” said Hendricks. Somaya Stockenstroom
