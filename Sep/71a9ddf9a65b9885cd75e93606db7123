Poor Andile Lungisa – the not-so-young chap would have South Africans believe he is a peace-time political prisoner. No sir, you’re a thug who deserves to do his time in a cold, lonely cell. We don’t go around breaking glass jars on people’s heads. Don’t try a Tony Yengeni on us – common criminals must be brought to book. Enjoy your two-year stay in prison, tata. Xolile Mtshazo
