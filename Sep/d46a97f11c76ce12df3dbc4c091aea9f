The ANC has apologised for using the SANDF  flight with defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula for the trip to Zimbabwe. The ruling party was strongly criticised for abusing state resources after it travelled in the state aircraft for discussions with Zanu-PF to resolve  simmering tensions in the country. After several statements justifying the usage of the aircraft, the ANC finally swallowed its pride and apologised in statement issued by party Secretary General Ace Magashule on Tuesday. Magashule said  the party will reimburse government for the costs incurred by its delegates. “Finally, is that in our quest to achieve this mission, we travelled in an unusual manner and profusely humble ourselves where we went wrong during the lockdown and will reimburse the government for the costs incurred on behalf of our delegation. Our delegation is under quarantine in line with our lockdown regulations,” reads the statement. Magashule further  said  the ANC  also welcomes and concurs with the comments made by the ZANU PF Secretary of Administration, comrade Obert Mpofu, that the recent engagement between the two parties was both frank and constructive, conducted in the fraternal spirit of two liberation movements. He said the organisation will return to Zimbabwe to continue with  the discussion . “As the ANC we would like to appreciate the success of our delegation mission of national interest to Zimbabwe with both hands because a successful and prosperous Zimbabwe as our neighbour is good for South Africa, the SADC region and our beloved continent Africa. We hope and trust that the positive results of our consultation will go a long way in ensuring regional stability and growth in the two countries,” he said. Ngwako Malatji
